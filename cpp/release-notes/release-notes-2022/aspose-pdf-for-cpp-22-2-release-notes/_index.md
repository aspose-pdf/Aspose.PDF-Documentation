## Changes and Improvements

The new version of Aspose.PDF for C++ has a codebase of Aspose.PDF for .Net 22.2.

1. The PathGradientBrush::get_InterpolationColors() method was fixed for some brushes.

## Backward Incompatible API Changes

1. Some pointer type declarations (e. g. **StreamPtr**) were moved from the global namespace to **System** namespace.

1. The supported **glibc** version will be changed in the upcoming releases.

1. The new **IEnumerable**-level iterators and iterators for collections with duck typing will be introduced in one of the upcoming releases. The code which is dependent on **EnumeratorBasedIterator** or **DuckTypedIterator** may require some changes.

Complete details of API can be referenced from [Aspose.PDF for C++ API Reference Guide](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp).
