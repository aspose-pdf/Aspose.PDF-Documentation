**This page is an overview of  Aspose.PDF for C++ features.**

Aspose.PDF for C++ is a native C++ library that enable developers to create and manipulate PDF documents without using Adobe Acrobat.Â Aspose.PDF for C++ allows developers to create forms, add/edit text, manipulate PDF pages, add annotations, handle custom fonts and much more. Here in documentation section of Aspose.PDF for C++, you can explore all the features of the API along with the basic examples to demonstrate the implementation of those features in your C++ application.

Using this library, you can implement rich capabilities for creating PDF files from scratch, or completely process existing PDF documents without installing Adobe Acrobat. The Aspose.PDF for C++ supports a **Wide Variety of Functions**.

### Document compression

Compressing PDF documents helps reduce their file size, making them easier to store, share, and transfer over networks. This is particularly important when dealing with large PDF files that contain high-resolution images or graphics. Smaller file sizes result in faster loading times, especially when accessing PDF documents online or via email attachments. Compressed PDFs load quicker, improving user experience and productivity.
**Aspose.PDF for C++ Library** provides different ways to reduce the size of your PDF, such as:

- shrinking or compressing all images
- removing unused PDF objects
- removing unused PDF streams
- linking duplicate PDF streams
- unembedding fonts
- removing or flattening annotations
- removing AcroForm Fields
- using flateDecode compression
- store images in XImageCollection (reusable images)
- convert a PDF from RGB color space to grayscale

Let's check Docs pages for more details: [Optimize PDF](/pdf/cpp/optimize-pdf/)

### Table creation and manipulation

Tables provide a structured and organized format for presenting information in PDF documents. They allow users to categorize and arrange data into rows and columns, making it easier to comprehend complex datasets. 

With **Aspose.PDF for C++** creating and manipulating tables in PDF documents offers numerous advantages, including improved data organization, enhanced readability, better analysis capabilities, and increased flexibility in presenting information effectively. 

Let's check the next section for more details: [Working with Tables](/pdf/cpp/working-with-tables/)

### Support for Graph objects

**Aspose.PDF for C++** supports adding graphs to PDF documents. The Graph class is provided for this task.  
Adding Graphs to PDF documents  improve data visualization, enhanced clarity and comprehension, better decision-making support, and increased engagement with readers.

Let's check Docs pages for more details: [Working with Graphs](/pdf/cpp/graphs/)

### Extensive Hyperlink functionality

Hyperlinks allow users to navigate quickly and efficiently within a PDF document. By clicking on hyperlinks, readers can jump to different sections, chapters, or pages without having to manually scroll through the document. 

**Aspose.PDF for C++** provides many advantages, including improved navigation, cross-referencing, access to external resources, interactivity, and enhanced communication. They contribute to a more engaging, informative, and accessible reading experience for users.

Let's check the next section for more details: [Actions](/pdf/cpp/actions/)

### Extended Security controls

Security features such as digital signatures help ensure the integrity of PDF documents. By digitally signing a document, the sender can verify that the content has not been tampered with or altered since it was signed, providing assurance to recipients regarding the authenticity of the document.

With **Aspose.PDF for C++** is possible to sign PDF from Smart Card, encrypt, and decrypt files, extract images, and Signature info etc. 

Let's check Docs pages for more details: [Securing and Signing](/pdf/cpp/securing-and-signing/)

### Add or remove Bookmarks

Bookmarks provide users with a convenient way to navigate large or complex PDF documents. By creating bookmarks for specific sections, chapters, or headings, users can easily jump to relevant content with just a click, saving time and effort.

Using **Aspose.PDF for C++** library you can add bookmarks to a PDF file, add a child bookmark, or delete all or particular bookmarks from the document.

Let's check the next section for more details: [Bookmarks](/pdf/cpp/add-and-delete-bookmark/)

### Create a table of contents

The TOC provides users with a quick and efficient way to navigate through the contents of a PDF document. By listing the major sections, chapters, or topics along with their corresponding page numbers, users can easily locate and access specific information within the document.
The **Aspose.PDF for C++** library explain how to add a TOC to an existing PDF file, use the Heading class in the Aspose.Pdf namespace.

Let's check Docs pages for more details: [Working with TOC](/pdf/cpp/manipulate-pdf-document/)

###  Add, update, delete attachments and annotations

Adding attachments and annotations makes PDF documents more interactive and engaging for readers. Users can interact with additional content, such as multimedia files, links, or comments, embedded within the document, enhancing their reading experience.

The Aspose.PDF for C++ library has a different of manipulations with [Annotations](/pdf/cpp/annotations/). You can add such types as:

- Text Annotation
- Highlights Annotation
- Figures Annotation
- Multimedia Annotation
- Sticky Annotations
- Extra Annotations

Also, our Library allows you to add, extract, and remove Attachments from PDF. 
For more details check the next [Documentation pages](/pdf/cpp/attachments/).

###  PDF File Metadata

Metadata provides essential information about the PDF document, such as the title, author, creation date, and subject. This helps users quickly identify and categorize documents, making it easier to manage and organize large collections of PDF files.

PDF file metadata serves multiple purposes, including document identification, attribution, version tracking, description, searchability, accessibility, security, interoperability, preservation, and compliance.

Easily and quickly manage [Metadata](/pdf/cpp/pdf-file-metadata/) in a PDF document with a **Aspose.PDF for C++** library.

### Add, replace or remove text and images

Adding, replacing, or removing text and images allows users to edit the content of PDF documents, making updates, corrections, or enhancements as needed. This flexibility enables users to modify the document's content to reflect changes or revisions accurately.

With Aspose.PDF you can edit text inside PDF, replace or rotate it, search or get text in PDF.

You can also add, change position, delete images, and make more [complex actions](/pdf/cpp/working-with-images/) with images in your PDF.

### Split, concatenate, extract or inset pages

The [Working with PDF Pages](/pdf/cpp/working-with-pages/) section in Docs explains how you can add, move, delete, rotate, or split pages in PDF.

Splitting, concatenating, extracting, or inserting pages helps users manage PDF documents more effectively. Users can organize, rearrange, or combine pages to create new documents, improving document organization and accessibility.

### Transform pages to image

Converting PDF pages to images makes the content more accessible to users who may have difficulty viewing or interacting with PDF documents directly. Images can be easily viewed on various devices, including smartphones, tablets, and computers, without requiring specialized software.

Aspose.PDF allows to convert PDF to different image formats using C++. There are:

- TIFF
- BMP
- EMF
- JPG
- PNG
- GIF
- SVG

Aspose.PDF Library using DocumentDevice, or ImageDevice class for PDF to Image conversion.[Convert PDF to Different Image Formats](/pdf/cpp/convert-pdf-to-images-format/).

### Print PDF documents

Printing PDF documents allows users to create physical copies that can be easily transported and accessed without the need for electronic devices.

Aspose.PDF for C++ present different ways to print PDF files:

- Printing PDF using C++ Framework 4.x
- Printing PDF in C++ Core / C++
- Printing PDF to an XPS Printer using Facades (console app)
- Printing PDF in WPF application
- various additional operations, like PDF to PostScript conversion, Checking Print Job Status etc.

Let's check the next section for more details: [Printing PDF documents](/pdf/cpp/printing-document/).

In addition, Aspose.PDF for C++ can be applied to easily convert text, images, SVG, HTML to PDF and convert PDF to various document formats with excellent performance and good quality.
