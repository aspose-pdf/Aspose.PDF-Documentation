# Installation

## Evaluate Aspose.PDF for C++

You can easily download Aspose.PDF for C++ for evaluation. The evaluation download is the same as the purchased download. The evaluation version simply becomes licensed when you add a few lines of code to apply the license.

The evaluation version of Aspose.PDF (without a license specified) provides full product functionality, but it has two limitations: it inserts an evaluation watermark, and only four elements of any collection can be viewed/edited.

If you want to test Aspose.PDF for C++ without the evaluation version limitations, you can also request a 30-day Temporary License. Please refer to [How to get a Temporary License?](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license)

## Installing Aspose.PDF for C++ through NuGet

NuGet is a free, open source developer-focused package management system for the C++ platform intent on simplifying the process of incorporating third party libraries into a C++ application during development. It is a Visual Studio extension that makes it easy to add, remove, and update libraries and tools in Visual Studio projects that use the C++ Framework. A library or tool can easily be shared with other developers by creating a NuGet package and storing it inside a [NuGet repository](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspose.PDF.Cpp/). When you install the package, NuGet copies files to your solution and automatically makes the necessary changes, such as adding references and changing your app.config or web.config files. If you decide to remove the library, NuGet removes files and reverses whatever changes it made to your project so that no clutter is left.
