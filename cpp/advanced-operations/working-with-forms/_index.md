AcroForms are PDF files that contain form fields. Data can be entered into these fields by end-users or the author of the form. Internally, AcroForms are annotations or fields applied to a PDF document.

Aspose.PDF for C++ allows you to efficiently work with forms in PDF documents.

Yes, you can just create a blank PDF, add the labels and fields you want, and after save it.
Can I create a fillable PDF form from an existing document? What are the form fields? How to extract form from PDF file?
