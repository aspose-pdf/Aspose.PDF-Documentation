**Aspose.PDF for C ++** allows you to perform various manipulations with Pages in your PDF document.
You will be able to insert a page into a PDF document anywhere in the file, as well as add pages to the end of the PDF file.

This section shows you how to add pages to PDF without using Acrobat Reader.
Also, with the Aspose.PDF for C++ library, you will be able to rotate pages, delete them, change the page size, and much more.

You can add text or images to the headers and footers of your PDF, and you can select different headers in your document with C++.

Add watermarks, number your pages, add backgrounds to pages in your PDF. The Aspose.PDF for C++  will allow you to resolve all these tasks.
