A stamp in a PDF document is analogous to applying a rubber stamp on a paper document.
The Stamp in the PDF file gives the additional information for the PDF file, such as to protect the PDF file to be used by others and to confirm the security of the contents of the PDF file. **Aspose.PDF for C++** allows adding image or text stamp in your PDF document.
