description: This section demonstrates how to manage and modify PDF form fields using Aspose.PDF for Python via .NET. It covers practical examples of flattening specific fields, flattening all form fields, and renaming existing fields programmatically. By using the Form facade, developers can bind a PDF document, adjust field behavior, and save the updated file with permanent changes applied.
