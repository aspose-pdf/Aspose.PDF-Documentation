Do you need to separate images from your PDF files? For simplified management, archiving, analysis, or sharing images of your documents, use **Aspose.PDF for Python** and extract images from PDF files.

Images are held in each page's [resources](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/page/#properties) collection's [XImage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/ximagecollection/) collection. To extract a particular page, then get the image from the Images collection using the particular index of the image.

The image's index returns an [XImage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/ximage/) object. This object provides a [save()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/document/#methods) method which can be used to save the extracted image. The following code snippet shows how to extract images from a PDF file.

```python

    import aspose.pdf as ap

    # Open document
    document = ap.Document(input_file)

    # Extract a particular image
    xImage = document.pages[2].resources.images[1]
    outputImage = io.FileIO(output_image, "w")

    # Save output image
    xImage.save(outputImage)
    outputImage.close()
```
