## Fundamentals of AcroForms

**AcroForms** - unique PDF form technology from Adobe. AcroForms is a page-oriented form. They first appeared in 1998. They accept input in the form of Data format or FDF and XML form Data format or xFDF. Third-party providers support AcroForms. When Adobe introduced AcroForms, they called them the "PDF form, which is the author of Adobe Acrobat Pro/Standard and is not a special type of static or dynamic XFA form. AcroForms are portable and work on all platforms.```

You can use AcroForms to add additional pages to the PDF form document. Thanks to the concept of Templates, you can use AcroForms to support populating the form with multiple database records.

PDF 1.7 supports two different methods for integrating data and PDF forms.

*AcroForms (also known as Acrobat forms)*, introduced and included in the PDF 1.2 format specification.

For more detailed learning of the capabilities of the Java library, see the following articles:

- [Create AcroForm](/pdf/python-net/create-form) - create form from scratch with Python.
- [Fill AcroForm](/pdf/python-net/fill-form) - fill form field in your PDF document.
- [Extract AcroForm](/pdf/python-net/extract-form) - get value from all or an individual field of PDF document.
