Abstract: The article "Working with AcroForms using Python" provides a beginner-level overview of handling AcroForms in PDF documents using the Aspose.PDF library for Python. AcroForms, a technology developed by Adobe, allows users to interact with PDF forms using data formats like FDF and xFDF. These forms are highly portable and platform-independent, offering functionality such as adding pages and populating forms with database records. The article outlines the methods supported by PDF 1.7 for integrating data with forms, emphasizing AcroForms' capabilities. It also references additional resources for creating, filling, and extracting data from AcroForms using Python. The Aspose.PDF for Python library is highlighted as a tool for PDF document generation and manipulation, with support for various operating systems and a high user rating.

## Fundamentals of AcroForms

**AcroForms** - unique PDF form technology from Adobe. AcroForms is a page-oriented form. They first appeared in 1998. They accept input in the form of Data format or FDF and XML form Data format or xFDF. Third-party providers support AcroForms. When Adobe introduced AcroForms, they called them the "PDF form, which is the author of Adobe Acrobat Pro/Standard and is not a special type of static or dynamic XFA form. AcroForms are portable and work on all platforms.```

You can use AcroForms to add additional pages to the PDF form document. Thanks to the concept of Templates, you can use AcroForms to support populating the form with multiple database records.

PDF 1.7 supports two different methods for integrating data and PDF forms.

*AcroForms (also known as Acrobat forms)*, introduced and included in the PDF 1.2 format specification.
