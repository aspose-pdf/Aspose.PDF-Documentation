AlternativeHeadline: How to work with AcroForms with Python
Abstract: AcroForms, introduced by Adobe in 1998, represent a unique PDF form technology that is page-oriented and compatible across all platforms. Unlike static or dynamic XFA forms, AcroForms allow for data input through FDF and xFDF formats. Supported by third-party providers, AcroForms can be used to add pages to PDF documents and populate forms with multiple database records, making them versatile for various applications. This technology, part of the PDF 1.2 format specification and supported up to PDF 1.7, offers two methods for integrating data with PDF forms. For practical applications and further learning, resources are available on creating, filling, and extracting AcroForms using Python.

## Fundamentals of AcroForms

**AcroForms** - unique PDF form technology from Adobe. AcroForms is a page-oriented form. They first appeared in 1998. They accept input in the form of Data format or FDF and XML form Data format or xFDF. Third-party providers support AcroForms. When Adobe introduced AcroForms, they called them the "PDF form, which is the author of Adobe Acrobat Pro/Standard and is not a special type of static or dynamic XFA form. AcroForms are portable and work on all platforms.```

You can use AcroForms to add additional pages to the PDF form document. Thanks to the concept of Templates, you can use AcroForms to support populating the form with multiple database records.

PDF 1.7 supports two different methods for integrating data and PDF forms.

*AcroForms (also known as Acrobat forms)*, introduced and included in the PDF 1.2 format specification.
