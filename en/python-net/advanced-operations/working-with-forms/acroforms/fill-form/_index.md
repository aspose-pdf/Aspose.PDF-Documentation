AlternativeHeadline: How to fill form field in PDF using Python
Abstract: The article provides a guide on how to fill a form field in a PDF document using the Aspose.PDF library for Python. It explains the process of accessing a form field from the document's form collection and setting its value via the field's value property. The example code demonstrates how to open a PDF document, iterate through its form fields to find a specific field by its partial name (in this case, "Field 1"), and modify the value of a TextBoxField to "777". Finally, the updated document is saved to an output file. Links to the relevant Aspose documentation are provided for further reference.

## Fill Form Field in a PDF Document

To fill a form field, get the field from the Document object's [Form](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf.forms/form/) collection. then set the field value using the field's [value](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf.forms/form/#properties) property.

This example selects a [TextBoxField](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf.forms/textboxfield/) and sets its value using the Value property.

```python

    import aspose.pdf as ap

    # Open document
    pdfDocument = ap.Document(input_file)
    for formField in pdfDocument.form.fields:
        if formField.partial_name == "Field 1":
            # Modify field value
            formField.value = "777"

    # Save updated document
    pdfDocument.save(output_pdf)
```
