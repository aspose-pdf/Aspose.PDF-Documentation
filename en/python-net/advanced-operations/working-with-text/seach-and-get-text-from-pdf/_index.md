AlternativeHeadline: How to Search and Get Text from Pages in PDF
Abstract: The article provides an in-depth exploration of text extraction and manipulation capabilities within PDF documents using the Aspose.PDF for Python via .NET library. It introduces the TextFragmentAbsorber class, which allows developers to search through an entire document or specific pages for designated phrases or regular expression patterns. The page outlines various practical scenarios—such as retrieving text content, determining its position (including coordinates and indent values), and extracting font properties like name, size, embed status, and color—from the matched text fragments. Detailed code examples demonstrate the process step-by-step, making it easier for developers to integrate text searching capabilities into their applications.

## Search Text from PDF

Search and extract text from a defined rectangular area in a PDF document using the TextAbsorber class. It employs pure text formatting mode for clean, unformatted text output, making it ideal for extracting content from structured regions like headers, footers, or table areas. By combining TextExtractionOptions and TextSearchOptions with rectangular constraints, this example gives you fine control over where and how text is extracted from the document.

1. Load the PDF file using 'ap.Document'.
1. Configure Text Extraction Options.
1. Define Search Area with Rectangle Constraints.
1. Create and Configure TextAbsorber.
1. Process All Pages in the Document.
1. Retrieve and Display Extracted Text.

```python

import io
import os
import re
import shutil
import aspose.pdf as ap
import aspose.pydrawing as drawing

# Global configuration
DATA_DIR = "your path here"

def text_absorber_search(input_file_path):
    """
    Search and extract text from PDF using TextAbsorber with area constraints.

    Demonstrates basic text extraction from a PDF document using TextAbsorber
    with pure text formatting mode and rectangular boundary constraints.
    Extracts text from all pages within the specified rectangular area.

    Args:
        input_file_path (str): Path to the input PDF file to search.

    Returns:
        None: Prints extracted text to console.

    Note:
        - Uses PURE text formatting mode for clean text extraction
        - Constrains search to rectangle (0, 0, 842, 250)
        - Processes all pages in the document
        - TextAbsorber provides high-level text extraction capabilities
        - Good for extracting text content without detailed positioning

    Example:
        >>> text_absorber_search("document.pdf")
        # Prints all text found in the specified rectangular area across all pages
    """
    # Open PDF document
    document = ap.Document(input_file_path)

    text_extraction_options = ap.text.TextExtractionOptions(
        ap.text.TextExtractionOptions.TextFormattingMode.PURE
    )
    text_search_options = ap.text.TextSearchOptions(ap.Rectangle(0, 0, 842, 250, True))

    absorber = ap.text.TextAbsorber(text_extraction_options, text_search_options)

    # Process all pages
    document.pages.accept(absorber)

    print(f"Text fragments found: {absorber.text}")
```

## Search Text from a Specific PDF page

Search and extract text from a specific page and region in a PDF using Aspose.PDF’s TextAbsorber. It targets page 2 of the document and extracts only the text found within a defined rectangular area.
By combining TextExtractionOptions (for formatting control) and TextSearchOptions (for area limitation), you can perform precise, page-specific text extraction efficiently.

1. Load the PDF Document.
1. Set Up Text Extraction Options.
1. Restrict text extraction to a specific rectangular area on the page.
1. Create and Configure TextAbsorber.
1. Process a Specific Page.
1. Retrieve and Display Extracted Text.

```python

import io
import os
import re
import shutil
import aspose.pdf as ap
import aspose.pydrawing as drawing

# Global configuration
DATA_DIR = "your path here"

def text_absorber_search_page(input_file_path):
    """
    Search and extract text from a specific PDF page using TextAbsorber.

    Demonstrates targeted text extraction from a single page (page 2) using
    TextAbsorber with area constraints. Shows how to limit search scope to
    specific pages and rectangular regions.

    Args:
        input_file_path (str): Path to the input PDF file to search.

    Returns:
        None: Prints extracted text from page 2 to console.

        - Useful for page-specific text extraction
        - More efficient than processing entire document when targeting specific pages

    Example:
        >>> text_absorber_search_page("document.pdf")
        # Prints text found in the specified area on page 2 only
    """
    document = ap.Document(input_file_path)

    text_extraction_options = ap.text.TextExtractionOptions(
        ap.text.TextExtractionOptions.TextFormattingMode.PURE
    )
    text_search_options = ap.text.TextSearchOptions(ap.Rectangle(0, 0, 842, 250, True))

    absorber = ap.text.TextAbsorber(text_extraction_options, text_search_options)

    # Only page 2
    document.pages[2].accept(absorber)

    print(f"Text fragments found: {absorber.text}")

```

## Analyze and Extract Detailed Text Fragment Properties from a PDF

Unlike TextAbsorber, which extracts raw text, TextFragmentAbsorber provides detailed, low-level information about each text fragment—such as its position, font attributes, color, and embedding details.

1. Load the PDF Document.
1. Initialize TextFragmentAbsorber.
1. Process All Pages in the Document.
1. Iterate Through Extracted Text Fragments.
1. Print Basic Text Information.
1. Print Font and Formatting Details.

```python

import io
import os
import re
import shutil
import aspose.pdf as ap
import aspose.pydrawing as drawing

# Global configuration
DATA_DIR = "your path here"

def text_fragment_absorber_search(input_file_path):
    """

        - Shows font accessibility, embedding, and subset information
        - Useful for detailed text analysis and formatting inspection
        - TextFragmentAbsorber offers more granular control than TextAbsorber

    Example:
        >>> text_fragment_absorber_search("document.pdf")
        # Prints comprehensive details about every text fragment in the document
    """
    document = ap.Document(input_file_path)

    absorber = ap.text.TextFragmentAbsorber()
    document.pages.accept(absorber)

    for fragment in absorber.text_fragments:
        print("Text:", fragment.text)
        print("Position:", fragment.position)
        print("XIndent:", fragment.position.x_indent)
        print("YIndent:", fragment.position.y_indent)
        print("Font - Name:", fragment.text_state.font.font_name)
        print("Font - IsAccessible:", fragment.text_state.font.is_accessible)
        print("Font - IsEmbedded:", fragment.text_state.font.is_embedded)
        print("Font - IsSubset:", fragment.text_state.font.is_subset)
        print("Font Size:", fragment.text_state.font_size)
        print("Foreground Color:", fragment.text_state.foreground_color)
```

## Search for a Specific Text Phrase on a Single PDF Page

Search for a specific text phrase within a page of a PDF document using TextFragmentAbsorber. Unlike searching the entire document, this approach limits the search to just one page, making it more efficient for confirming the presence and location of text in targeted areas like headers, footers, or specific content sections.

1. Load the PDF Document.
1. Initialize TextFragmentAbsorber with Search Phrase.
1. Apply Absorber to Specific Page.
1. Iterate Over Found Fragments.

```python

import io
import os
import re
import shutil
import aspose.pdf as ap
import aspose.pydrawing as drawing

# Global configuration
DATA_DIR = "your path here"

def text_fragment_absorber_search_page(input_file_path):
    """
    Search for specific text phrase on a particular PDF page.

    Demonstrates targeted text search for a specific phrase ("whale") on
    a single page. Shows how to combine phrase searching with page-specific
    scope for efficient and focused text location.

    Args:
        input_file_path (str): Path to the input PDF file to search.

    Returns:
        None: Prints matching text fragments and their positions to console.

    Note:
        - Searches for the phrase "whale" on page 2 only
        - Returns text fragments with position information
        - More efficient than document-wide search when targeting specific pages
        - Useful for validating content presence in specific document sections
        - Provides exact positioning coordinates for found text

    Example:
        >>> text_fragment_absorber_search_page("document.pdf")
        # Prints all instances of "whale" found on page 2 with their positions
    """
    document = ap.Document(input_file_path)

    absorber = ap.text.TextFragmentAbsorber("whale")
    document.pages[2].accept(absorber)

    for fragment in absorber.text_fragments:
        print("Text:", fragment.text)
        print("Position:", fragment.position)
```

## Sequential Page-by-Page Text Search with Cumulative Results

Search text incrementally across multiple pages of a PDF document using Aspose.PDF’s TextFragmentAbsorber.
Unlike a single-page or document-wide search, this approach allows you to process pages sequentially, collect results progressively, and analyze text fragments with page-specific context. This method is ideal for large documents or progressive processing workflows.

1. Load the PDF Document.
1. Initialize TextFragmentAbsorber and Set Search Phrase.
1. Process First Page. Search only page 1. Prints text, page number, and position. Provide isolated page-specific results for clarity.
1. Process Next Page Sequentially. Move to page 2 and optionally continue through the rest of the document. The 'absorber.visit()' ensures the accumulation of results from all visited pages. Prints the cumulative search results, showing both text and location.

```python

import io
import os
import re
import shutil
import aspose.pdf as ap
import aspose.pydrawing as drawing

# Global configuration
DATA_DIR = "your path here"

def text_fragment_absorber_sequential_search(input_file_path):
    """
    Demonstrate sequential page-by-page text search with cumulative results.

    Shows how to perform incremental text searches across multiple pages,
    accumulating results from each page. Demonstrates both individual page
    processing and document-wide search continuation.

    Args:
        input_file_path (str): Path to the input PDF file to search.

    Returns:
        None: Prints text fragments from sequential page searches to console.

    Note:

        - Uses absorber.visit(document) to process remaining pages
        - Demonstrates incremental search accumulation
        - Shows page numbers for found fragments
        - Useful for progressive document processing and result accumulation

    Example:
        >>> text_fragment_absorber_sequential_search("document.pdf")
        # Prints "whale" instances from page 1, then from all remaining pages
    """
    document = ap.Document(input_file_path)

    absorber = ap.text.TextFragmentAbsorber()
    absorber.phrase = "whale"

    # First page
    document.pages[1].accept(absorber)
    for fragment in absorber.text_fragments:
        print("Text:", fragment.text)
        print("Page:", fragment.page.number)
        print("Position:", fragment.position)

    print("--")

    # Continue to next page
    document.pages[2].accept(absorber)
    absorber.visit(document)

    for fragment in absorber.text_fragments:
        print("Text:", fragment.text)
        print("Page:", fragment.page.number)
        print("Position:", fragment.position)
```

## Targeted Phrase Search within a Rectangular Area

Search for a specific phrase within a PDF while constraining the search to a specific rectangular area on a single page.
By combining phrase search with spatial constraints, you can locate content precisely in designated regions without scanning the entire page or document. This is particularly useful for forms, headers, footers, or structured reports where content appears in predictable locations.

1. Load the PDF Document.
1. Initialize TextFragmentAbsorber with Phrase and Rectangular Constraints
1. Apply Absorber to Page 2. Restricts processing to page 2, reducing unnecessary computation. Ensures search is page-specific.
1. Iterate Through Found Fragments and Print

        - More precise than page-wide or document-wide searches

    Example:
        >>> text_fragment_absorber_search_phrase("document.pdf")
        # Prints "elephant" instances found within the specified rectangular area on page 2
    """
    document = ap.Document(input_file_path)

    absorber = ap.text.TextFragmentAbsorber(
        "elephant", ap.text.TextSearchOptions(ap.Rectangle(0, 0, 842, 250, True))
    )

    document.pages[2].accept(absorber)

    for fragment in absorber.text_fragments:
        print("Text:", fragment.text)
        print("Position:", fragment.position)
```

## Text Pattern Search in PDF Using Regular Expressions

Search for text patterns in a PDF using regular expressions. By enabling regex mode in TextFragmentAbsorber, you can locate complex patterns such as numbers, dates, prices, coordinates, or custom text formats. The function limits the search to a specific page, making it efficient for targeted extraction of structured data.

        - Searches on page 2 only
        - Powerful for finding formatted data like prices, coordinates, dates
        - Regular expressions provide flexible pattern matching capabilities

    Example:
        >>> text_fragment_absorber_search_regex("document.pdf")
        # Prints all decimal numbers (e.g., "12.34", "0.99") found on page 2
    """
    document = ap.Document(input_file_path)

    absorber = ap.text.TextFragmentAbsorber(r"\d+\.\d+", ap.text.TextSearchOptions(is_regular_expression_used=True))

    document.pages[2].accept(absorber)

    for fragment in absorber.text_fragments:
        print("Text:", fragment.text)

Our example performs advanced text visualization on a PDF by:

 - searching for all visible text fragments using regular expressions
 - rendering each PDF page into a high-resolution PNG image
 - drawing colored rectangles around text fragments, text segments, and individual characters

1. Set Output Image Resolution. Each PDF page is converted into a 150 DPI PNG image.
1. Open the PDF and Initialize Text Absorber.
1. Process Each Page. Apply the absorber to every page. Collect all detected text fragments and their geometrical positions.
1. Convert Page to PNG Stream.
1. Prepare Graphics Object for Drawing.
1. Apply Coordinate Transformation. Convert PDF coordinates to image pixels.
1. Draw Rectangles for Text Elements.
1. Save the Result.
