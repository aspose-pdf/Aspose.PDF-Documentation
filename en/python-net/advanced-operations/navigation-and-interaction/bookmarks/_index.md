Using bookmarks in PDF is a very useful feature. With them, you can set up navigation on your documents, organize and structure PDF files, and make such files more accessible. They act as interactive links in the document, allowing users to quickly navigate to specific sections or pages.

PDF bookmarks are a handy and essential tool when it comes to reading PDF files. They allow users to quickly jump to other places in a PDF document, navigate through pages, and quickly view the contents of a PDF, just like a table of contents.
In this section you will learn how to:
