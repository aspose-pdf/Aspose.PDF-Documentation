- [Bookmarks](/pdf/python-net/bookmarks/)- large publications usually include a framework of bookmarks that can be easily viewed and selected in the Bookmarks Pane, allowing you to click on a bookmark to jump to the page or chapter it represents. The Bookmarks Pane is a content-aware element, and is visible in the side-bar only if the open PDF document contains a bookmark structure.
