Annotations in PDFs are interactive elements that allow you to add notes, highlight text, draw shapes, attach files, and perform other actions that improve browsing, interactivity, and interaction.

The Aspose.PDF for Python Library supports various types of annotations, including text annotations (such as text, and popup annotation), highlights annotations (such as text markup), figures annotations( such as circle, polyline, polygon, line, and ink), multimedia annotations ( there are screen, sound, widget, and 3D)  and more.

Annotations can be used to comment, review, mark documents, provide feedback, or add additional information. Annotations allow to establish cooperation, facilitate communication, and improve understanding of the content of documents. They enhance collaboration, improve communication, and make PDF documents more dynamic and engaging for users.
