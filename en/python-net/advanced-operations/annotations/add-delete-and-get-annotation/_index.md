AlternativeHeadline: How to manipulate annotations in PDF with Python
Abstract: Annotations in PDF documents enhance user interaction by allowing the addition of various elements such as notes, text highlights, shapes, and file attachments. These features improve the document's viewing experience and interactivity. The Aspose.PDF for Python library categorizes annotations into several groups- Text Annotations, Highlights Annotations, Figures Annotations, Sticky Annotations, and Extra Annotations, each serving different functions to enrich document engagement and usability.

**What are annotations in PDF documents?**

Annotations in PDF documents are elements that allow users to allocate content in a certain way in the document. Annotations can be used to add different types of notes, highlight text, draw shapes, attach files, and perform other actions that improve viewing, interactivity, and interaction within a document.

We have combined the different kinds of annotation available for the Aspose.PDF for Python  library into groups:

- [PDF Text Annotation](/pdf/python-net/text-annotation/)
- [PDF Highlights Annotation](/pdf/python-net/highlights-annotation/)
- [PDF Figures Annotation](/pdf/python-net/figures-annotation/)
- [PDF sticky Annotations](/pdf/python-net/sticky-annotations/)
- [Link Annotations](/pdf/python-net/link-annotations/)
- [Extra Annotations](/pdf/python-net/extra-annotations/)
