**What are annotations in PDF documents?**

Annotations in PDF documents are elements that allow users to allocate content in a certain way in the document. Annotations can be used to add different types of notes, highlight text, draw shapes, attach files, and perform other actions that improve viewing, interactivity, and interaction within a document.

We have combined the different kinds of annotation available for the Aspose.PDF for Python  library into groups:

- [PDF Text Annotation](/pdf/python-net/text-annotation/)
- [PDF Highlights Annotation](/pdf/python-net/highlights-annotation/)
- [PDF Figures Annotation](/pdf/python-net/figures-annotation/)
- [PDF sticky Annotations](/pdf/python-net/sticky-annotations/)
- [Extra Annotations](/pdf/python-net/extra-annotations/)
