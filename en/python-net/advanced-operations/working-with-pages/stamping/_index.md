A stamp in a PDF document is analogous to applying a rubber stamp on a paper document.
The Stamp in the PDF file gives the additional information for the PDF file, such as to protect the PDF file to be used by others and to confirm the security of the contents of the PDF file. **Aspose.PDF for Python via .NET** allows adding image or text stamp in your PDF document.

Check the following sections to learn how to add a stamp with Python:

- [Add Image stamps in PDF page](/pdf/python-net/image-stamps-in-pdf-page/) - add image stamp, control image quality, image stamp as background your PDF file.
- [Add Text stamps in the PDF File](/pdf/python-net/text-stamps-in-the-pdf-file/) - add text stamp, define alignment for TextStamp object, fill stroke text as stamp in PDF file.
