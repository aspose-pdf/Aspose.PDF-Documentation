AlternativeHeadline: How to work with pages in PDF using Python
Abstract: Aspose.PDF for Python via .NET provides comprehensive tools for manipulating PDF files programmatically without the need for Acrobat Reader. The library enables users to insert pages at any location within a PDF document, add pages to the end of a file, and delete pages as needed. Users can enhance their documents by adding text or images to headers and footers and applying watermarks using the Artifact class. Additional features include changing page sizes, rotating page orientations, splitting documents, moving pages between files, and cropping pages with specified properties. The library also supports adding page numbers via the PageNumberStamp class and creating background images using watermarks. Stamping capabilities are provided through the ImageStamp and TextStamp classes, allowing for the addition of image and text stamps. Furthermore, users can access and modify PDF page properties, such as color and other attributes, ensuring detailed customization of PDF documents. The library offers a user-friendly interface and thorough documentation for each feature, facilitating easy integration and utilization within Python.

**Aspose.PDF for Python via .NET** lets you insert a page to a PDF document at any location in the file as well as add pages to the end of a PDF file. This section shows how to add pages to a PDF without Acrobat Reader.
You can add text or images in the headers and footers of your PDF file, and choose different headers in your document with Python library by Aspose.
Also, try to crop pages in PDF document programmatically using Python.

This section learn you how to add watermarks in your PDF file using Artifact class. You will check the programming sample for this task.
Add Page number using [PageNumberStamp](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/pagenumberstamp/) class. For adding a Stamp in your document use [ImageStamp](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/imagestamp/) and [TextStamp](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/textstamp/) classes. Use adding a watermark for creating background images in your PDF file with **Aspose.PDF for Python via .NET**.

You are able to do the following:

- [Add Pages](/pdf/python-net/add-pages/) - add pages at desired location or to the end of a PDF file and delete a page from you document.
- [Move Pages](/pdf/python-net/move-pages/) - move pages from one document to another.
- [Delete Pages](/pdf/python-net/delete-pages/) - delete page from your PDF file using PageCollection collection.
- [Change Page size](/pdf/python-net/change-page-size/) - you can change PDF page size with code snippet using Aspose.PDF library.
- [Rotate Pages](/pdf/python-net/rotate-pages/) - you can change the page orientation of pages in an existing PDF file.
- [Split Pages](/pdf/python-net/split-document/) - you can split PDF files into one or multiple PDF.
- [Add Headers and/or Footers](/pdf/python-net/add-headers-and-footers-of-pdf-file/) - add text or images in the headers and footers of your PDF file .
- [Crop Pages](/pdf/python-net/crop-pages/) - you can crop pages in PDF document programmatically with different Page Properties.
- [Add Watermarks](/pdf/python-net/add-watermarks/) - add watermarks in your PDF file with Artifact Class.
- [Add Page Numbering in PDF File](/pdf/python-net/add-page-number/) - PageNumberStamp class will help you to add a Page Number in your PDF file.
- [Add Backgrounds](/pdf/python-net/add-backgrounds/) - background images can be used to add a watermark.
- [Stamping](/pdf/python-net/stamping/) - you can use the ImageStamp class to add an image stamp to a PDF file and TextStamp class for adding a text.
- [Get and Set Page Properties](/pdf/python-net/get-and-set-page-properties/) - this section shows how to get the number of pages in a PDF file, get information about PDF page properties such as color and set page properties.
