**Aspose.PDF for Python via .NET** lets you insert a page to a PDF document at any location in the file as well as add pages to the end of a PDF file. This section shows how to add pages to a PDF without Acrobat Reader.
You can add text or images in the headers and footers of your PDF file, and choose different headers in your document with Python library by Aspose.
Also, try to crop pages in PDF document programmatically using Python.

This section learn you how to add watermarks in your PDF file using Artifact class. You will check the programming sample for this task.
Add Page number using [PageNumberStamp](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/pagenumberstamp/) class. For adding a Stamp in your document use [ImageStamp](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/imagestamp/) and [TextStamp](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/textstamp/) classes. Use adding a watermark for creating background images in your PDF file with **Aspose.PDF for Python via .NET**.
