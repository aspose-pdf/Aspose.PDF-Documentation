**Advanced Operations** is a section about how to deals with existing PDF files programatically, be they documents created with Aspose.PDF as discussed in [Basic Operations](/pdf/python-net/basic-operations/), or PDFs created with Adobe Acrobat, Google Docs, Microsoft Office, Open Office or any other PDF producer.

You'll learn different ways to:

- [Working with Documents](/pdf/python-net/working-with-documents/) - compress, split, and merge documents and make other operations with the whole document.
- [Working with Pages](/pdf/python-net/working-with-pages/) - add, move or remove, crop pages, add watermarks, stamps, and etc.
- [Working with Images](/pdf/python-net/working-with-images/) - add, extract or remove images from PDF documents.
- [Attachments](/pdf/python-net/attachments/) - you will learn how to add and delete the attachment from PDF programmatically with Python.
- [Navigation and Interaction](/pdf/python-net/navigation-and-interaction/) - deal with actions, bookmarks, navigate pages.
- [Annotations](/pdf/python-net/annotations/) - annotations allow users to add custom content on PDF pages. You can add, delete and modify the annotation from the PDF documents.
- [Working with Tables](/pdf/python-net/working-with-tables/) - insert, decorate table in PDF, extract tabular data.
- [Working with Forms](/pdf/python-net/working-with-forms/) - deal with interact PDF documents, add formfields, extract data.
- [Working with Text](/pdf/python-net/working-with-text/) - add, format, search and replace text in PDF.
- [Compare PDF documents](/pdf/python-net/compare-pdf-documents/) - possible to compare PDF documents content.
- [Metadata in PDFs](/pdf/python-net/pdf-file-metadata/) - get or set meta data in documents, dealing with XMP data.
- [Working with Graphs](/pdf/python-net/working-with-graphs/) - manipulate with shapes on the page.
- [Working with Operators](/pdf/python-net/working-with-operators/) - make low-level operations in PDF.
- [Artifacts](/pdf/python-net/artifacts/) - deal with watermarks and other special objects in PDF.
- [Working with PDF layers](/python-net/work-with-pdf-layers/) -
