## Add Line object

Aspose.PDF for Python via .NET supports the feature to add graph objects (for example graph, line, rectangle etc.) to PDF documents. You also get the leverage to add [Line](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf.drawing/line/) object where you can also specify the dash pattern, color and other formatting for Line element.

Follow the steps below:

1. Create [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/document/) instance.
1. Create a Graph Object
1. Add [Graph](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf.drawing/graph/) object to paragraphs collection of page.
1. Create and Configure the Line
1. Add the [Line](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf.drawing/line/) to the Graph
1. Save our PDF file.

```python

    import aspose.pdf as ap
    import aspose.pdf.drawing as drawing
    import datetime

    # Create Document instance
    document = ap.Document()

    # Add page to pages collection of PDF file
    page = document.pages.add()

    # Create Graph instance
    graph = drawing.Graph(100, 400)

    # Add graph object to paragraphs collection of page instance
    page.paragraphs.add(graph)

    # Create Rectangle instance
    line = drawing.Line([100, 100, 200, 100])

    # Specify fill color for Graph object
    line.graph_info.dash_array = [0, 1, 0]
    line.graph_info.dash_phase = 1

    # Add rectangle object to shape collection of Graph object
    graph.shapes.append(line)

    # Save PDF file
    document.save(path_outfile)
```

## How to add Dotted Dashed Line to your PDF document

```python

    import aspose.pdf as ap
    import aspose.pdf.drawing as drawing
    import datetime

    # Create Document instance
    document = ap.Document()

    # Add page to pages collection of PDF file
    page = document.pages.add()

    # Create Graph instance
    graph = drawing.Graph(100, 400)

    # Add graph object to paragraphs collection of page instance
    page.paragraphs.add(graph)

    # Create Rectangle instance
    line = drawing.Line([100, 100, 200, 100])

    # Set color for Line object
    line.graph_info.color = ap.Color.red

    # Specify fill color for Graph object
    line.graph_info.dash_array = [0, 1, 0]
    line.graph_info.dash_phase = 1

    # Add rectangle object to shape collection of Graph object
    graph.shapes.append(line)

    # Save PDF file
    document.save(path_outfile)
```

Let's check the result:

## Draw Line Across the Page

We can also use line object to draw a cross starting from Left-Bottom to Right-Upper corner and Left-Top corner to Bottom-Right corner.

Please take a look over following code snippet to accomplish this requirement.

```python

    import aspose.pdf as ap
    import aspose.pdf.drawing as drawing
    import datetime

    # Create Document instance
    document = ap.Document()

    # Add page to pages collection of PDF file
    page = document.pages.add()

    # Set page margin on all sides as 0
    page.page_info.margin.left = 0
    page.page_info.margin.right = 0
    page.page_info.margin.bottom = 0
    page.page_info.margin.top = 0

    # Create Graph object with Width and Height equal to page dimensions
    graph = drawing.Graph(page.page_info.width, page.page_info.height)

    # Create first line object starting from Lower-Left to Top-Right corner of page
    line = drawing.Line([page.rect.llx, 0, page.page_info.width, page.rect.ury])

    # Add line to shape collection of Graph object
    graph.shapes.append(line)

    # Draw line from Top-Left corner of page to Bottom-Right corner of page
    line2 = drawing.Line([0, page.rect.ury, page.page_info.width, page.rect.llx])

    # Add line to shape collection of Graph object
    graph.shapes.append(line2)

    # Add Graph object to paragraphs collection of page
    page.paragraphs.add(graph)

    # Save PDF file
    document.save(path_outfile)
```
