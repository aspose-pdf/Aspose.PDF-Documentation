## Python PDF to PowerPoint and PPTX Conversion

**Aspose.PDF for Python via .NET** lets you track the progress of PDF to PPTX conversion.

We have an API named Aspose.Slides which offers the feature to create as well as manipulate PPT/PPTX presentations. This API also provides the feature to convert PPT/PPTX files to PDF format. During this conversion, the individual pages of the PDF file are converted to separate slides in the PPTX file.

During PDF to <abbr title="Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 XML Presentation">PPTX</abbr> conversion, the text is rendered as Text where you can select/update it. Please note that in order to convert PDF files to PPTX format, Aspose.PDF provides a class named [PptxSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/pptxsaveoptions/). An object of the PptxSaveOptions class is passed as a second argument to the [save()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/document/#methods). The following code snippet shows the process for converting PDF files into PPTX format.
