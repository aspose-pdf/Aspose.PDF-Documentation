A "Hello World" example shows the simplest syntax and the simplest program in any given programming language. Developers are introduced to the basic programming language syntax by learning how to print "Hello World" on the device screen. Therefore, we will traditionally start our acquaintance with our library from it.

In this article, we are creating a PDF document containing text "Hello World!". After installing **Aspose.PDF for Python via .NET** in your environment, you can execute below code sample to see how Aspose.PDF API works.

Below code snippet follows these steps:

1. Instantiate a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/document/) object
1. Add a [Page](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/page/) to document object
1. Create a [TextFragment](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf.text/textfragment/) object
1. Add TextFragment to [paragraphs](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/page/#properties) collection of the page
1. [save()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/document/#methods) resultant PDF document

Following code snippet is a "Hello World" program to exhibit working of Aspose.PDF for Python via .NET API.

```python

    import aspose.pdf as ap

    # Initialize document object
    document = ap.Document()
    # Add page
    page = document.pages.add()
    # Initialize textfragment object
    text_fragment = ap.text.TextFragment("Hello,world!")
    # Add text fragment to new page
    page.paragraphs.add(text_fragment)
    # Save updated PDF
    document.save("output.pdf")
```
