**Aspose.Pdf for Reporting Services** is a robust .NET solution which allows you to produce PDF reports using Microsoft SQL Server 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2022 Reporting Services, and Microsoft Power BI Report Server. Aspose.Pdf for Reporting Services does not operate independently, but is a rendering extension for the SQL Reporting Services. Not only it supports the basic report elements such as tables, charts, images, Headers/Footers, lines etc but, it also provides the capability to add custom properties which gives its an extra leverage upon SQL Reporting Services. While using these properties, you can generate List of Contents which is not supported by Report Designer. You may have Footnotes/Endnotes in the resultant PDF document which is natively not supported by Report Builder. Another interesting feature is to have Line Arrows which is also not supported by SQL Reporting Services, but Aspose.Pdf for Reporting Services can provide the capability to add arrows at the beginning or the end of the line element. Moreover, Aspose.Pdf for Reporting Services provides the functionality to specify the text alignment (Justify or FullJustify) information which is not supported by Report Designer. These text modes make the resultant document better formatted and easy-readable.

Alongside the previously mentioned features, you can also set certain other configuration parameters for the reports, to get features which are not natively supported by SQL Reporting Services. Following is a brief rundown of such features which are offered by Aspose.Pdf for Reporting Services

## Security Settings

Sometimes you might wish to export PDF document protected with a password, with limited text copying and printing privileges. Unfortunately, Reporting Services does not support this possibility. However, you still can implement it using Aspose.Pdf for Reporting Services. Just add corresponding security parameters to report or report server to obtain a secure PDF document with limited privileges. For more information, please refer to the 'Security Setting' section.

## Custom Font Embedding

Reporting Services designer does not support the embedded font for text; with Aspose.Pdf for Reporting Services you can easily embed font information into your PDF document. For more information, please refer to the 'IsFontEmbedded' section.

## XMP Metadata

Reporting Services designer does not support embedding the XMP metadata. Aspose.Pdf for Reporting Services provides four parameters (CreationDate, ModifyDate, MetaDataDate and CreatorTool) to set the corresponding XMP Metadata. For more information, please refer to the 'XMP Metadata' section.

## PDF/A

When using SQL Server Reporting Services, you can only generate the PDF document in simple format whereas the generation of PDF/A documents is not supported. But Aspose.Pdf for Reporting Services provides the feature to create PDF/A compliant documents with the addition of a single configuration parameter. For more information, please refer to the 'PDF Conformance' section.

## Page Rotation Angle

When using Aspose.Pdf for Reporting Services, you can set the number of degrees by which the page should be rotated clockwise when displayed or printed. For more information, please refer to the 'Page Rotating Angle' section.

## Page Margin Size

Reporting Services designer does not support setting the page margins size. Aspose.Pdf for Reporting Services, on the other hand, provides four parameters to set the corresponding page margin size. They are PageMarginLeft, PageMarginRight, PageMarginTop, and PageMarginBottom. For more information, please refer to the 'Page Margin Size' section.
