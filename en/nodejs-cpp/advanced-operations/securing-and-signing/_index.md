This section describes how to securely digitally sign PDF documents in the Node.js environment. The terms electronic signature and digital signature are used interchangeably, but essentially the two are different. More generally, a digital signature comes with a [certification authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) approved seal and is used to protect the signed document from tampering. Instead, an electronic signature is often used to demonstrate the intention to sign a document.
