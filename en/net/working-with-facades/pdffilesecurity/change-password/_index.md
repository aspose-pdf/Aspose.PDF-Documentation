## Change Password of a PDF File

In order to change password of a PDF file, you need to create [PdfFileSecurity](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdffilesecurity) object and then call the [ChangePassword](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades.pdffilesecurity/changepassword/methods/2) method. You need to pass existing owner password and new user and owner passwords to the [ChangePassword](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades.pdffilesecurity/changepassword/methods/2) method.

- The **User password**, if set, is what you need to provide in order to open a PDF. Acrobat/Reader will prompt a user to enter the user password. If it's not correct, the document will not open.
- The **Owner password**, if set, controls permissions, such as printing, editing, extracting, commenting, etc. Acrobat/Reader will disallow these things based on the permission settings. Acrobat will require this password if you want to set/change permissions.

The following code snippet shows you how to change passwords of a PDF file.

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, check for https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET

private static void ChangePassword()
{
    // The path to the documents directory
    string dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf_SecuritySignatures();

    using (var pdfFileInfo = new Aspose.Pdf.Facades.PdfFileInfo(dataDir + "sample_encrypted.pdf"))
    {
        // Create PdfFileSecurity object if the document is encrypted
        if (pdfFileInfo.IsEncrypted)    
        {
            using (var fileSecurity = new Aspose.Pdf.Facades.PdfFileSecurity())
            {
                fileSecurity.BindPdf(dataDir + "sample_encrypted.pdf");
                fileSecurity.ChangePassword("OwnerP@ssw0rd", "Pa$$w0rd1", "Pa$$w0rd2", Aspose.Pdf.Facades.DocumentPrivilege.Print, Aspose.Pdf.Facades.KeySize.x256);
                // Save PDF document
                fileSecurity.Save(dataDir + "sample_encrtypted1.pdf");
            }
        }
    }
}
```
