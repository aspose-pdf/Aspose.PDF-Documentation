A PDF document encrypted with a password or certificate must be unlocked before another operation can be performed on it. If you try to operate on an encrypted PDF document, you will throw an exception. After unlocking an encrypted PDF, you can perform one or more operations on it.

In order to decrypt a PDF file, you need to create [PdfFileSecurity](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdffilesecurity) object and then call the [DecryptFile](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdffilesecurity/methods/decryptfile) method. You also need to pass the owner password to [DecryptFile](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdffilesecurity/methods/decryptfile) method. The following code snippet shows you how to decrypt PDF file.

```csharp
public static void DecryptPDFFile()
{
    PdfFileInfo pdfFileInfo = new PdfFileInfo(dataDir + "sample_encrypted.pdf");
    // Create PdfFileSecurity object
    if (pdfFileInfo.IsEncrypted)
    {
        PdfFileSecurity fileSecurity = new PdfFileSecurity();
        fileSecurity.BindPdf(dataDir + "sample_encrypted.pdf");
        // Decrypt PDF document
        fileSecurity.DecryptFile("P@ssw0rd");
        fileSecurity.Save(dataDir + "sample_decrtypted.pdf");
    }
}
```
