## Extract Images from the Whole PDF to Files (Facades)

[PdfExtractor](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor) class allows you to extract images from a PDF file. First off, you need to create an object of [PdfExtractor](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor) class and bind input PDF file using [BindPdf](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/facade/methods/bindpdf/index) method. After that, call [ExtractImage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor/methods/extractimage) method to extract all the images into memory. Once the images are extracted, you can get those images with the help of [HasNextImage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor/methods/hasnextimage) and [GetNextImage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades.pdfextractor/getnextimage/methods/1) methods. You need to loop through all the extracted images using a while loop. In order to save the images to disk, you can call the overload of the [GetNextImage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades.pdfextractor/getnextimage/methods/1) method which takes file path as argument. The following code snippet shows you how to extract images from the whole PDF to files.

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, visit https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET
private static void ExtractImagesWholePDF()
{
    // The path to the documents directory
    var dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf_Images();

    // Open PDF document
    using (var extractor = new Aspose.Pdf.Facades.PdfExtractor())
    {
        extractor.BindPdf(dataDir + "sample_cats_dogs.pdf");

        // Extract all the images
        extractor.ExtractImage();

        // Get all the extracted images
        while (extractor.HasNextImage())
        {
            extractor.GetNextImage(dataDir + DateTime.Now.Ticks.ToString() + "_out.jpg");
        }
    }
}
```

## Extract Images from the Whole PDF to Streams (Facades)

[PdfExtractor](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor) class allows you to extract images from a PDF file into streams. First off, you need to create an object of [PdfExtractor](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor) class and bind input PDF file using [BindPdf](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/facade/methods/bindpdf/index) method. After that, call [ExtractImage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor/methods/extractimage) method to extract all the images into memory. Once the images are extracted, you can get those images with the help of [HasNextImage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor/methods/hasnextimage) and [GetNextImage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades.pdfextractor/getnextimage/methods/1) methods. You need to loop through all the extracted images using a while loop. In order to save the images to stream, you can call the overload of the [GetNextImage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades.pdfextractor/getnextimage/methods/1) method which takes Stream as argument. The following code snippet shows you how to extract images from the whole PDF to streams.

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, visit https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET
private static void ExtractImagesWholePDFStreams()
{
    // The path to the documents directory
    var dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf_Images();

    // Open PDF document
    using (var extractor = new Aspose.Pdf.Facades.PdfExtractor())
    {
        extractor.BindPdf(dataDir + "sample_cats_dogs.pdf");

        // Extract images
        extractor.ExtractImage();
        // Get all the extracted images
        while (extractor.HasNextImage())
        {
            // Read image into memory stream
            MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream();
            extractor.GetNextImage(memoryStream);

            // Write to disk, if you like, or use it otherwise
            using (FileStream fileStream = new FileStream(dataDir + DateTime.Now.Ticks.ToString() + "_out.jpg", FileMode.Create))
            {
                memoryStream.WriteTo(fileStream);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Extract Images from a Particular Page of a PDF (Facades)

You can extract images from a particular page of a PDF file. In order to do that, you need to set [StartPage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor/properties/startpage) and [EndPage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor/properties/endpage) properties to the particular page you want to extract images from. First of all, you need to create an object of [PdfExtractor](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor) class and bind input PDF file using [BindPdf](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/facade/methods/bindpdf/index) method. Secondly, you have to set [StartPage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor/properties/startpage) * and [EndPage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor/properties/endpage) properties. After that, call [ExtractImage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor/methods/extractimage) method to extract all the images into memory. Once the images are extracted, you can get those images with the help of [HasNextImage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor/methods/hasnextimage) and [GetNextImage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades.pdfextractor/getnextimage/methods/1) methods. You need to loop through all the extracted images using a while loop. You can either save the images to disk or stream. You only need to call the appropriate overload of [GetNextImage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades.pdfextractor/getnextimage/methods/1) method. The following code snippet shows you how to extract images from a particular page of PDF to streams.

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, visit https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET
private static void ExtractImagesParticularPage()
{
    // The path to the documents directory
    var dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf_Images();

    // Open PDF document
    using (var extractor = new Aspose.Pdf.Facades.PdfExtractor())
    {
        extractor.BindPdf(dataDir + "sample_cats_dogs.pdf");

        // Set StartPage and EndPage properties to the page number to
        // You want to extract images from
        extractor.StartPage = 2;
        extractor.EndPage = 2;

        // Extract images
        extractor.ExtractImage();
        // Get extracted images
        while (extractor.HasNextImage())
        {
            // Read image into memory stream
            MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream();
            extractor.GetNextImage(memoryStream);

            // Write to disk, if you like, or use it otherwise
            using (FileStream fileStream = new FileStream(dataDir + DateTime.Now.Ticks.ToString() + "_out.jpg", FileMode.Create))
            {
                memoryStream.WriteTo(fileStream);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Extract Images from a Range of Pages of a PDF (Facades)

You can extract images from a range of pages of a PDF file. In order to do that, you need to set [StartPage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor/properties/startpage)  and [EndPage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor/properties/endpage) properties to the range of pages you want to extract images from. First of all, you need to create an object of [PdfExtractor](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor) class and bind input PDF file using [BindPdf](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/facade/methods/bindpdf/index) method. Secondly, you have to set [StartPage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor/properties/startpage)  and [EndPage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor/properties/endpage) properties. After that, call [ExtractImage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor/methods/extractimage) method to extract all the images into memory. Once the images are extracted, you can get those images with the help of [HasNextImage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor/methods/hasnextimage) and [GetNextImage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades.pdfextractor/getnextimage/methods/1) methods. You need to loop through all the extracted images using a while loop. You can either save the images to disk or stream. You only need to call the appropriate overload of [GetNextImage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades.pdfextractor/getnextimage/methods/1) method. The following code snippet shows you how to extract images from a range of pages of PDF to streams.

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, visit https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET
private static void ExtractImagesRangePages()
{
    // The path to the documents directory
    var dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf_Images();

    // Open input PDF
    using (var extractor = new Aspose.Pdf.Facades.PdfExtractor())
    {
        extractor.BindPdf(dataDir + "sample_cats_dogs.pdf");

        // Set StartPage and EndPage properties to the page number to
        // You want to extract images from
        extractor.StartPage = 2;
        extractor.EndPage = 2;

        // Extract images
        extractor.ExtractImage();

        // Get extracted images
        while (extractor.HasNextImage())
        {
            // Read image into memory stream
            MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream();
            extractor.GetNextImage(memoryStream);

            // Write to disk, if you like, or use it otherwise
            using (FileStream fileStream = new
            FileStream(dataDir + DateTime.Now.Ticks.ToString() + "_out.jpg", FileMode.Create))
            {
                memoryStream.WriteTo(fileStream);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Extract Images using Image Extraction Mode (Facades)

[PdfExtractor](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor) class allows you to extract images from a PDF file. Aspose.PDF supports two extraction modes; first is ActuallyUsedImage which extract the images actually used in the PDF document. Second mode is [DefinedInResources](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/extractimagemode) which extract the images defined in the resources of the PDF document (default extraction mode). First, you need to create an object of [PdfExtractor](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor) class and bind input PDF file using [BindPdf](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/facade/methods/bindpdf/index) method. After that, specify the image extraction mode using [PdfExtractor.ExtractImageMode](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor/properties/extractimagemode) property. Then call [ExtractImage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor/methods/extractimage) method to extract all the images into memory depending on the mode you specified. Once the images are extracted, you can get those images with the help of [HasNextImage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor/methods/hasnextimage) and [GetNextImage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades.pdfextractor/getnextimage/methods/1) methods. You need to loop through all the extracted images using a while loop. In order to save the images to disk, you can call the overload of the [GetNextImage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades.pdfextractor/getnextimage/methods/1) method which takes file path as argument.

The following code snippet shows you how to extract images from PDF file using ExtractImageMode option.

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, visit https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET
private static void ExtractImagesImageExtractionMode()
{
    // The path to the documents directory
    var dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf_Images();

    // Open PDF document
    using (var extractor = new Aspose.Pdf.Facades.PdfExtractor())
    {
        extractor.BindPdf(dataDir + "sample_cats_dogs.pdf");

        // Specify Image Extraction Mode
        //extractor.ExtractImageMode = ExtractImageMode.ActuallyUsed;
        extractor.ExtractImageMode = Aspose.Pdf.ExtractImageMode.DefinedInResources;

        // Extract Images based on Image Extraction Mode
        extractor.ExtractImage();

        // Get all the extracted images
        while (extractor.HasNextImage())
        {
            extractor.GetNextImage(dataDir + DateTime.Now.Ticks.ToString() + "_out.png", System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Png);
        }
    }
}
```

For checking if Pdf contains Text Or Images use next code snippet:

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, visit https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET
private static void CheckIfPdfContainsTextOrImages()
{
    // The path to the documents directory
    var dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf_Images();

    // Instantiate a memoryStream object to hold the extracted text from Document
    MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();
    // Instantiate PdfExtractor object
    using (var extractor = new Aspose.Pdf.Facades.PdfExtractor())
    {
        // Bind the input PDF document to extractor
        extractor.BindPdf(dataDir + "FilledForm.pdf");
        // Extract text from the input PDF document
        extractor.ExtractText();
        // Save the extracted text to a text file
        extractor.GetText(ms);
        // Check if the MemoryStream length is greater than or equal to 1

        bool containsText = ms.Length >= 1;

        // Extract images from the input PDF document
        extractor.ExtractImage();

        // Calling HasNextImage method in while loop. When images will finish, loop will exit
        bool containsImage = extractor.HasNextImage();

        // Now find out whether this PDF is text only or image only

        if (containsText && !containsImage)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("PDF contains text only");
        }
        else if (!containsText && containsImage)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("PDF contains image only");
        }
        else if (containsText && containsImage)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("PDF contains both text and image");
        }
        else if (!containsText && !containsImage)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("PDF contains neither text or nor image");
        }
    }
}
```
