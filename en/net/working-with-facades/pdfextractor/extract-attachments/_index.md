One of the main category under the extraction capabilities of [Aspose.Pdf.Facades namespace](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades) is the attachment extraction. This category provides a set of methods, which not only help extract the attachments but also provides the methods which can give you the attachment related information i.e. [GetAttachmentInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor/methods/getattachmentinfo) and [GetAttachName](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor/methods/getattachnames) methods provide attachment information and attachment name respectively. In order to extract and then get attachments we use [ExtractAttachment](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor/methods/extractattachment) and [GetAttachment](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfextractor/methods/getattachment) methods.

The following code snippet shows you how to use PdfExtractor methods:

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, visit https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET
private static void ExtractAttachments()
{
    // The path to the documents directory
    var dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf_Attachments();

    // Create the extractor
    using (var pdfExtractor = new Aspose.Pdf.Facades.PdfExtractor())
    {
        pdfExtractor.BindPdf(dataDir + "GetAlltheAttachments.pdf");

        // Extract attachments
        pdfExtractor.ExtractAttachment();

        // Get attachment names
        if (pdfExtractor.GetAttachNames().Count > 0)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Extracting and storing...");

            // Get extracted attachments
            pdfExtractor.GetAttachment(dataDir + "GetAlltheAttachments_out.pdf");
        }
    }
}
```
