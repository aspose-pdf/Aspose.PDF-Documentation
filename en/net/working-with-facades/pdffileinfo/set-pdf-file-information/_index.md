[PdfFileInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdffileinfo) class allows you to set file specific information of a PDF file. You need to create an object of [PdfFileInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdffileinfo) class and then set different file specific properties like Author, Title, Keyword, and Creator etc. Finally, save the updated PDF file using [SaveNewInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades.pdffileinfo/savenewinfo/methods/1) method of the [PdfFileInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdffileinfo) object.

The following code snippet shows you how to set PDF file information.

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, visit https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET
private static void SetPdfInfo()
{
    // Define the directory for input and output files
    var dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf();

    // Create PdfFileInfo object to work with PDF metadata
    using (var fileInfo = new Aspose.Pdf.Facades.PdfFileInfo(dataDir + "sample.pdf"))
    {
        // Set PDF information
        fileInfo.Author = "Aspose";
        fileInfo.Title = "Hello World!";
        fileInfo.Keywords = "Peace and Development";
        fileInfo.Creator = "Aspose";
        
        // Save the PDF with updated information
        fileInfo.SaveNewInfo(dataDir + "SetFileInfo_out.pdf");
    }
}
```

## Set Meta Info

[SetMetaInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdffileinfo/methods/setmetainfo) method allows you to add any information. In our example, we added a field. Check next code snippet:

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, visit https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET
private static void SetMetaInfo()
{
    // Define the directory for input and output files
    var dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf();

    // Create an instance of the PdfFileInfo object
    using (var fileInfo = new Aspose.Pdf.Facades.PdfFileInfo(dataDir + "sample.pdf"))
    {
        // Set a new custom attribute as meta info
        fileInfo.SetMetaInfo("Reviewer", "Aspose.PDF user");

        // Save the updated file
        fileInfo.SaveNewInfo(dataDir + "SetMetaInfo_out.pdf");
    }
}
```
