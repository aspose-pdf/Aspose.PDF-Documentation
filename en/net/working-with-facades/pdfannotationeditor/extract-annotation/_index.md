[ExtractAnnotations](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades.pdfannotationeditor/extractannotations/methods/1) method allows you to extract annotations from a PDF file. In order to extract annotations, you need to create [PdfAnnotationEditor](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfannotationeditor) object and bind PDF file using [BindPdf](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades.facade/bindpdf/methods/3) method. After that, you need to create an enumeration of annotation types which you want to extract from PDF file. 

You can then use [ExtractAnnotations](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades.pdfannotationeditor/extractannotations/methods/1) method to extract the annotations to an ArrayList. After that, you can loop through this list and get individual annotations. And finally, save the updated PDF file using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document/methods/save) method of the [PdfAnnotationEditor](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdfannotationeditor) object. The following code snippet shows you how to extract annotations from PDF file.

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, visit https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET
private static void ExtractAnnotation()
{
    // The path to the documents directory
    string dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdfFacades_Annotations();

    // Open PDF document
    using (var document = new Aspose.Pdf.Document(dataDir + "AnnotationsInput.pdf"))
    {
        using (var annotationEditor = new Aspose.Pdf.Facades.PdfAnnotationEditor())
        {
            // Bind PDF document
            annotationEditor.BindPdf(document);
            // Extract annotations
            var annotationTypes = new[] { Aspose.Pdf.Annotations.AnnotationType.FreeText, Aspose.Pdf.Annotations.AnnotationType.Text };
            var annotations = annotationEditor.ExtractAnnotations(1, 2, annotationTypes);
            foreach (var annotation in annotations)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(annotation.Contents);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
