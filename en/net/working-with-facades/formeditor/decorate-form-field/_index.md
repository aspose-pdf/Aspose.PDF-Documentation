## Decorate a Particular Form Field in an Existing PDF File

[DecorateField](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/formeditor/methods/decoratefield) method present in [FormEditor](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/formeditor) class allows you to decorate a particular form field in a PDF file. If you want to decorate a particular field then you need to pass the field name to this method. However, before calling this method, you need to create objects of [FormEditor](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/formeditor) and [FormFieldFacade](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/formfieldfacade) classes. You also need to assign the [FormFieldFacade](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/formfieldfacade) object to [Facade](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/facade/properties/index) property of the [FormEditor](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.forms/formeditor) object. After that, you can set any attributes provided by [FormFieldFacade](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/formfieldfacade) object. Once you have set the attributes, you can call the [DecorateField](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/formeditor/methods/decoratefield) method and finally save the updated PDF using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/form/methods/save/index) method of [FormEditor](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/formeditor) class.
The following code snippet shows you how to decorate a particular form field.

```csharp
public static void DecorateField()
{
    var editor = new FormEditor();
    editor.BindPdf(dataDir + "Sample-Form-01.pdf");

    var cityDecoration = new FormFieldFacade
    {
        Font = FontStyle.Courier,
        FontSize = 12,
        BorderColor = System.Drawing.Color.Black,
        BorderWidth = 2
    };

    editor.Facade = cityDecoration;
    editor.DecorateField("City");
    editor.Save(dataDir + "Sample-Form-02.pdf");
}
```

## Decorate All Fields of a Particular Type in an Existing PDF File

[DecorateField](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades.formeditor/decoratefield/methods/1) method allows you to decorate all the form fields of a particular type in a PDF file at once. If you want to decorate all fields of a particular type then you need to pass the field type to this method. However, before calling this method, you need to create objects of [FormEditor](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/formeditor) and [FormFieldFacade](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/formfieldfacade) classes. You also need to assign the [FormFieldFacade](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/formfieldfacade) object to [Facade](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/facade/properties/index) property of the [FormEditor](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.forms/formeditor) object. After that, you can set any attributes provided by [FormFieldFacade](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/formfieldfacade) object. Once you have set the attributes, you can call the [DecorateField](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades.formeditor/decoratefield/methods/1) method and finally save the updated PDF using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/form/methods/save/index) method of [FormEditor](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/formeditor) class. The following code snippet shows you how to decorate all the fields of a particular type.


```csharp
public static void DecorateField2()
{
    var editor = new FormEditor();
    editor.BindPdf(dataDir + "Sample-Form-01.pdf");

    var textFieldDecoration = new FormFieldFacade
    {
        Alignment = FormFieldFacade.AlignCenter,
    };

    editor.Facade = textFieldDecoration;
    editor.DecorateField(FieldType.Text);
    editor.Save(dataDir + "Sample-Form-01-align-text.pdf");
}
