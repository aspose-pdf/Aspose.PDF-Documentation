private static void CopyInnerField()
{
    // The path to the documents directory
    var dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf();

    // Create an instance of FormEditor object
    using (var formEditor = new Aspose.Pdf.Facades.FormEditor())
    {
        // Open PDF document
        using (var document = new Aspose.Pdf.Document(dataDir + "Sample-Form-01.pdf"))
        {
            // Add a new page to the document
            document.Pages.Add();

            // Bind the document to the formEditor
            formEditor.BindPdf(document);

            // Copy the field "Last Name" from the first page to "Last Name 2" on the second page
            formEditor.CopyInnerField("Last Name", "Last Name 2", 2);

            // Save PDF document
            formEditor.Save(dataDir + "Sample-Form-01-mod.pdf");
        }
    }
}
```
