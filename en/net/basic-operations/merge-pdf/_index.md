## Merge or combine multiple PDF into single PDF in C#

Merging PDF in C# is not straightforward task without using 3rd party library.
This article shows how to merge multiple PDF files into a single PDF document using Aspose.PDF for .NET. The example is written in C# but the API can be used in other .NET programming languages as well such as VB.NET. PDF files are merged such that the first one is joined at the end of the other document.

The following code snippet also work with [Aspose.PDF.Drawing](/pdf/net/drawing/) library.

## Merge PDF Files

To concatenate two PDF files:

1. Create two [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document)  objects, each containing one of the input PDF files.
1. Then call the [PageCollection](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/pagecollection) collection's Add method for the Document object you want to add the other PDF file to.
1. Pass the PageCollection collection of the second Document object to the first PageCollection collection's Add method.
1. Finally, save the output PDF file using the [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.document/save/methods/4) method.

The following code snippet shows how to concatenate PDF files.

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, visit https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET
private static void MergeDocuments()
{
    // The path to the documents directory
    var dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf_Pages();

    // Open PDF documents
    using (var document1 = new Aspose.Pdf.Document(dataDir + "Concat1.pdf"))
    {
        using (var document2 = new Aspose.Pdf.Document(dataDir + "Concat2.pdf"))
        {
            // Add pages of second document to the first
            document1.Pages.Add(document2.Pages);

            // Save PDF document
            document1.Save(dataDir + "MergeDocuments_out.pdf");
        }
    }
}
```
