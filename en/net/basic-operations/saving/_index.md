## Save PDF document to file system

You can save the created or manipulated PDF document to file system using `Save` method of `Document` class.
When you do not provide the format type (options), then the document is saved in Aspose.PDF v.1.7 (*.pdf) format.

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, visit https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET
private static void SaveDocument()
{
    // The path to the documents directory
    var dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf();

    // Open PDF document
    using (var document = new Aspose.Pdf.Document(dataDir + "SimpleResume.pdf"))
    {
        // Make some manipation, i.g add new empty page
        document.Pages.Add();
        // Save PDF document
        document.Save(dataDir + "SimpleResume_out.pdf");
    }
}
```

## Save PDF document to stream

You can also save the created or manipulated PDF document to stream by using overloads of `Save` methods.

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, visit https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET
private static void SaveDocumentStream()
{
    // The path to the documents directory
    var dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf();

    // Open PDF document
    using (var document = new Aspose.Pdf.Document(dataDir + "SimpleResume.pdf"))
    {
        // Make some manipation, i.g add new empty page
        document.Pages.Add();
        // Save PDF document
        document.Save(dataDir + "SimpleResume_out.pdf");
    }
}
```

## Save PDF/A or PDF/X format

PDF/A is an ISO-standardized version of the Portable Document Format (PDF) for use in archiving and long-term preservation of electronic documents.
PDF/A differs from PDF in that it prohibits features not suitable for long-term archiving, such as font linking (as opposed to font embedding) and encryption. ISO requirements for PDF/A viewers include color management guidelines, embedded font support, and a user interface for reading embedded annotations.

PDF/X is a subset of the PDF ISO standard. The purpose of PDF/X is to facilitate graphics exchange, and it therefore has a series of printing-related requirements which do not apply to standard PDF files.

In both cases, the `Save` method is used to store the documents, while the documents must be prepared using the `Convert` method.

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, visit https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET
private static void SaveDocumentAsPDFx()
{
    // The path to the documents directory
    var dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf();

    // Open PDF document
    using (var document = new Aspose.Pdf.Document(dataDir + "SimpleResume.pdf"))
    {
        // Add a new page
        document.Pages.Add();
        // Convert a document to a PDF/X-3 format
        document.Convert(new Aspose.Pdf.PdfFormatConversionOptions(Aspose.Pdf.PdfFormat.PDF_X_3));
        // Save PDF document
        document.Save(dataDir + "SimpleResume_X3.pdf");
    }
}
```
