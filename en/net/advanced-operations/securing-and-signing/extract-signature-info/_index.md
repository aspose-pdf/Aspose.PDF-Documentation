The following code snippet also work with [Aspose.PDF.Drawing](/pdf/net/drawing/) library.

## Extracting Image from Signature Field

Aspose.PDF for .NET supports the feature to digitally sign the PDF files using the [SignatureField](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.forms/signaturefield) class and while signing the document, you can also set an image for SignatureAppearance. Now, this API also provides the capability to extract signature information as well as the image associated with the signature field.

In order to extract signature information, we have introduced the [ExtractImage](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.forms/signaturefield/methods/extractimage) method to the SignatureField class. Please take a look at the following code snippet which demonstrates the steps to extract an image from the SignatureField object:

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, visit https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET
private static void ExtractImagesFromSignatureField()
{
    // The path to the documents directory
    var dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf_SecuritySignatures();

    // Open PDF document
    using (var document = new Aspose.Pdf.Document(dataDir + "ExtractingImage.pdf"))
    {
        // Searching for signature fields
        foreach (var field in document.Form)
        {
            var sf = field as Aspose.Pdf.Forms.SignatureField;
            if (sf == null)
            {
                continue;
            }

            using (Stream imageStream = sf.ExtractImage())
            {
                if (imageStream != null)
                {
                    continue;
                }

                using (System.Drawing.Image image = System.Drawing.Bitmap.FromStream(imageStream))
                {
                    // Save the image
                    image.Save(dataDir + "output_out.jpg", System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Jpeg);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Replace signature Image

Sometimes you may have a requirement to only replace the image of an already present signature field inside PDF file. In order to accomplish this requirement, first, we need to search form fields inside the PDF file, identify Signature fields, get the dimensions (Rectangular dimensions) of the signature field and then stamp an image over the same dimensions.

## Extract Signature Information

Aspose.PDF for .NET supports the feature to digitally sign the PDF files using the SignatureField class. Currently, we can also determine the validity of the certificate but we cannot extract the whole certificate. The information which can be extracted is a public key, thumbprint, issuer, etc.

To extract signature information, we have introduced the [ExtractCertificate](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.forms/signaturefield/methods/extractcertificate) method to the [SignatureField](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.forms/signaturefield) class. Please take a look at the following code snippet which demonstrates the steps to extract the certificate from SignatureField object:

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, visit https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET
private static void ExtractCertificate()
{
    // The path to the documents directory
    var dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf_SecuritySignatures();
    
    // Open PDF document
    using (var document = new Aspose.Pdf.Document(dataDir + "ExtractSignatureInfo.pdf"))
    {
        // Searching for signature fields
        foreach (var field in document.Form)
        {
            var sf = field as Aspose.Pdf.Forms.SignatureField;
            if (sf == null)
            {
                continue;
            }
            // Extract certificate
            Stream cerStream = sf.ExtractCertificate();
            if (cerStream == null)
            {
                continue;
            }
            // Save certificate
            using (cerStream)
            {
                byte[] bytes = new byte[cerStream.Length];
                using (FileStream fs = new FileStream(dataDir + "input.cer", FileMode.CreateNew))
                {
                    cerStream.Read(bytes, 0, bytes.Length);
                    fs.Write(bytes, 0, bytes.Length);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You can get information about document signature algorithms.

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, visit https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET
private void GetSignaturesInfo()
{
    // The path to the documents directory
    var dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf_SecuritySignatures();
            
    // Open PDF document
    using (var document = new Aspose.Pdf.Document(dataDir + "signed_rsa.pdf"))
    {
        using (var signature = new Aspose.Pdf.Facades.PdfFileSignature(document))
        {
            var sigNames = signature.GetSignatureNames();
            var signaturesInfoList =  signature.GetSignaturesInfo();
            foreach (var sigInfo in signaturesInfoList)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(sigInfo.DigestHashAlgorithm);
                Console.WriteLine(sigInfo.AlgorithmType);
                Console.WriteLine(sigInfo.CryptographicStandard);
                Console.WriteLine(sigInfo.SignatureName);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
