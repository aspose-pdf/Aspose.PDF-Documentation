With the release of Aspose.PDF for .NET 7.0.0, we introduced classes called [ImagePlacement](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/imageplacement), [ImagePlacementAbsorber](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/imageplacementabsorber) and [ImagePlacementCollection](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/imageplacementcollection) which provide similar capability as the classes described above to get an image's resolution and position in a PDF document.

- ImagePlacementAbsorber performs image usage search as the ImagePlacement objects collection.
- ImagePlacement provides the members Resolution and Rectangle that return actual image placement values.

The next code snippet also works with [Aspose.Drawing](/pdf/net/drawing/) library.

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET

private static void ExtractAndScaleImagesFromPDF()
{
    // The path to the documents directory
    var dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf_Images();

    // Load the document
    using (var document = new Aspose.Pdf.Document(dataDir + "ImagePlacement.pdf"))
    {
        var abs = new Aspose.Pdf.ImagePlacementAbsorber();

        // Load the contents of the first page
        document.Pages[1].Accept(abs);

        // Iterate through each image placement on the first page
        foreach (var imagePlacement in abs.ImagePlacements)
        {
            // Get image properties
            Console.Out.WriteLine("image width: " + imagePlacement.Rectangle.Width);
            Console.Out.WriteLine("image height: " + imagePlacement.Rectangle.Height);
            Console.Out.WriteLine("image LLX: " + imagePlacement.Rectangle.LLX);
            Console.Out.WriteLine("image LLY: " + imagePlacement.Rectangle.LLY);
            Console.Out.WriteLine("image horizontal resolution: " + imagePlacement.Resolution.X);
            Console.Out.WriteLine("image vertical resolution: " + imagePlacement.Resolution.Y);
        }
    }
}
```
