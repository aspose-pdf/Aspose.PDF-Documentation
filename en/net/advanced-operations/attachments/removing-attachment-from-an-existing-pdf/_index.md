Aspose.PDF can remove attachments from PDF files. A PDF document's attachments are held in the Document object's EmbeddedFiles collection.

The following code snippet also work with [Aspose.PDF.Drawing](/pdf/net/drawing/) library.

To delete all attachments associated with a PDF file:

1. Call the [EmbeddedFiles](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/embeddedfilecollection) collection's [Delete](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/embeddedfilecollection/methods/delete) method.
1. Save the updated file using the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) object's [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.document/save/methods/4) method.

The following code snippet shows how to remove attachments from a PDF document.

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, visit https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET
private static void DeleteAllAttachments()
{
    // The path to the documents directory
    string dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf_Attachments();

    // Open PDF document
    using (var document = new Aspose.Pdf.Document(dataDir + "DeleteAllAttachments.pdf"))
    {
        // Delete all attachments
        document.EmbeddedFiles.Delete();

        // Save PDF document
        document.Save(dataDir + "DeleteAllAttachments_out.pdf");
    }
}
```
