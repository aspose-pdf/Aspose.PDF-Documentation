## Aspose.PDF for .NET Library
_This page is an overview of  Aspose.PDF for .NET features._

**Aspose for .NET** is a modern and professional PDF API used to create, read-write, modify, and make other operations with PDF files without any external dependencies in a .NET application. You can use Aspose for .NET in any programming language for .NET or .NET Core.
This component is written in managed C# and it allows developers to add PDF creation and manipulation functionality to their Microsoft .NET applications (WinForms, WPF, ASP.NET and .NET Compact Framework).

Using this library, you can implement rich capabilities for creating PDF files from scratch, or completely process existing PDF documents without installing Adobe Acrobat. The Aspose.PDF for .NET supports a **Wide Variety of Functions**.

### Document compression

Compressing PDF documents helps reduce their file size, making them easier to store, share, and transfer over networks. This is particularly important when dealing with large PDF files that contain high-resolution images or graphics. Smaller file sizes result in faster loading times, especially when accessing PDF documents online or via email attachments. Compressed PDFs load quicker, improving user experience and productivity.
**Aspose.PDF for .NET Library** provides different ways to reduce the size of your PDF, such as:

- shrinking or compressing all images.
- removing unused PDF objects.
- removing unused PDF streams.
- linking duplicate PDF streams.
- unembedding fonts.
- removing or flattening annotations.
- removing AcroForm Fields.
- using flateDecode compression.
- store images in XImageCollection (reusable images).
- convert a PDF from RGB color space to grayscale.

Let's check Docs pages for more details: [Optimize PDF](/pdf/net/optimize-pdf/)

### Extensive Hyperlink functionality

Hyperlinks allow users to navigate quickly and efficiently within a PDF document. By clicking on hyperlinks, readers can jump to different sections, chapters, or pages without having to manually scroll through the document. 

**Aspose.PDF for .NET** provides many advantages, including improved navigation, cross-referencing, access to external resources, interactivity, and enhanced communication. They contribute to a more engaging, informative, and accessible reading experience for users.
