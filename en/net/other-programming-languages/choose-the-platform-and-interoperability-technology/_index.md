**There are three versions of the Aspose.PDF class library:**

[Aspose.PDF](/pdf/) is a product family that provides functionality to generate PDF documents from scratch, as well as the capability to edit/manipulate existing ones. Aspose.PDF is available in three distinct products: [Aspose.PDF for .NET](/pdf/net/), [Aspose.PDF for Java](/pdf/java/), and [Aspose.PDF for C++](/pdf/cpp/). We can say that Aspose.PDF “natively” supports:

- The .NET Framework and all programming languages targeting the .NET platform, such as C# or VB.NET.
- The Java platform and the Java programming language.
- The 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems and the C++ programming language.

Please note that it is also possible to use [Aspose.PDF for .NET](/pdf/net/) from many programming languages, including: ASP, C++, ColdFusion, Delphi, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, PowerBuilder, Python, VBScript etc.

## Support for other languages

{{% alert color="primary" %}}

This section contains suggestions and documentation links regarding how to use Aspose.PDF in different programming languages and covers the following topics:

- Available ready-made wrappers for [Aspose.PDF for .NET](/pdf/net/).
- How to create objects, call methods, and access properties of Aspose.PDF for .NET objects.

If you follow the principles outlined in this section, you will be able to employ many of the features of Aspose.PDF in your projects.

**Products based on Aspose.PDF for .NET class library:**

In addition to the three products mentioned above, Aspose proposes a set of solutions for different platforms and languages:

- [Aspose.PDF for Python via .NET](/pdf/python-net/) used to develop 32-bit and 64-bit Python applications for different operating systems.
- [Aspose.PDF for Reporting Services](/pdf/reportingservices/) makes possible generating PDF reports in Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services and Power BI Report Server.
- [Aspose.PDF for SharePoint](/pdf/sharepoint/) allows to export lists, list items and SharePoint Wiki pages to the PDF file format.

The full list of Aspose.PDF products may be found on [the page](/pdf/). It includes products based on [Aspose.PDF for Java](/pdf/java/) and PDF [Aspose.PDF for C++](/pdf/cpp/).

**Accessing Aspose.PDF objects from other languages**

Using Aspose.PDF from other programming languages requires an *interoperability technology* . This technology must enable your language to call a class library written for .NET, Java or C++. We suggest [COM Interop](/pdf/net/use-aspose-pdf-for-net-via-com-interop/) technology with [Aspose.PDF for .NET](/pdf/net/) class library to use for a variety of programming languages:
- ASP.
- Delphi.
- Perl.
- PHP.
- PowerBuilder.
- VBScript.
- Visual Basic.

Information about the interoperability technologies recommended to use with [Aspose.PDF for Java](/pdf/java/) and PDF [Aspose.PDF for C++](/pdf/cpp/) such as `Inline::Java` and `JPype` can be found on the corresponding [pages](/pdf/java/plugins/) of the products.

## Conclusion

{{% alert color="primary" %}}
The above article shows that the use of [Aspose.PDF for .NET](/pdf/net/) goes beyond .NET programming languages.
