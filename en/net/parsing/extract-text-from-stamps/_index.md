## Extract Text from Stamp Annotations

Aspose.PDF for NET lets you extract text from stamp annotations. In order to extract text from Stamp Annotations in a PDF, the following steps can be used.

1. Create a `Document` class object.
1. Get the desired `Annotation` from list of annotations of a page.
1. Define a new object of `TextAbsorber` class.
1. Use the TextAbsorber's visit method to get the Text.

The following code snippet also work with [Aspose.PDF.Drawing](/pdf/net/drawing/) library.

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, visit https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET
private static void ExtractText()
{
    // The path to the documents directory
    var dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf_Text();

    // Open PDF document
    using (var document = new Aspose.Pdf.Document(dataDir + "ExtractStampText.pdf"))
    {
        Aspose.Pdf.Annotations.Annotation item = document.Pages[1].Annotations[1];
        if (item is Aspose.Pdf.Annotations.StampAnnotation annot)
        {
            var absorber = new Aspose.Pdf.Text.TextAbsorber();
            Aspose.Pdf.XForm appearance = annot.Appearance["N"];
            absorber.Visit(appearance);
            Console.WriteLine(absorber.Text);
        }
    }
}
```
