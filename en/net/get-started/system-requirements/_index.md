## Overview
The API can be used to build applications on any operating system that supports .NET Standard 2.0 and later or .NET Framework 4.0.

To produce and manipulate PDF documents, the machine that Aspose.PDF for .NET runs on doesn't need to have Adobe Acrobat installed: Aspose.PDF for .NET is a PDF document creation engine.
