PDF files are great for exchanging formatted files between platforms and between people who do not use the same software, but sometimes we need to extract text from a PDF file for further use, such as in text documents, presentations, etc.

Depending on your needs for simple text extraction on one page, or in the entire document, or maybe you need to extract a specific paragraph - use the Aspose.PDf for C++ library, and choose the option that suits you best.
