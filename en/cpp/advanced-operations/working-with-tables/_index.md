You probably get data not only in the form of text or images, but it can also be tables with data embedded in reports or spreadsheets that have been saved as PDF files.

And of course, you will have to work with such tables.

**Aspose.PDF for C ++** allows you to work with tables in a PDF file advanced. This ideal tool helps to overcome the simplicity of PDFs by extracting tables of actual data. With a C ++ library resource, you can easily create or add a table to an existing PDF, extract the table, integrate the table with data sources, and remove tables from existing PDFs.

You are able to do the following:

- [Create or Add Table in existing PDF Document](/pdf/cpp/add-table-in-existing-pdf-document/) - create your table in pdf file with merging the columns or rows —Åonsidering borders, margins, and padding.
- [Extract a Table from existing PDF Document](/pdf/cpp/extract-table-from-existing-pdf-document/) - you can extract table from PDF file or extract table border as Image.
- [Manipulate Tables in existing PDF](/pdf/cpp/manipulate-tables-in-existing-pdf/) - manipulate tables in your PDF using TableAbsorber.
- [Remove Tables from existing PDF](/pdf/cpp/remove-tables-from-existing-pdf/) - remove table or multiple tables from PDF document.
