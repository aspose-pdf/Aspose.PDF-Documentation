As PDF is increasingly becoming the definitive form of document exchange, it is not unusual for a person to wonder how to add annotations to PDFs?

At first, it seems that the PDF file is really impossible to edit, but it is not, with our C++ library you will see for yourself.

Despite all the difficulties, PDF remains popular and very beloved by the user. There are many reasons for this, and the main one is portability. No matter what computer system you are using, you can use a PDF file, store it in your storage, and even share it.

So, to make edits, comments, add figures, links, highlights, underline or cross-out text, add audio, etc. - use the ability to add annotations to your PDF files with Aspose.PDF for C++.
