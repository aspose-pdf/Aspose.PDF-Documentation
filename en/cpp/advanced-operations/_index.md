**Advanced Operations** is a section about how to deals with existing PDF files programatically, be they documents created with Aspose.PDF as discussed in [Basic Operations](/pdf/cpp/basic-operations), or PDFs created with Adobe Acrobat, Google Docs, Microsoft Office, Open Office or any other PDF producer.

You'll learn different ways to:

- [Working with Documents](/pdf/cpp/working-with-documents/) - compress, split, and merge documents and make other operations with the whole document
- [Working with Pages](/pdf/cpp/working-with-pages/) - add, move or remove, crop pages, add watermarks, stamps
- [Working with Text](/pdf/cpp/working-with-text/) - add, format, search and replace text in PDF
- [Working with Images](/pdf/cpp/working-with-images/) - insert, remove, extract image in document
- [Working with Tables](/pdf/cpp/working-with-tables/) - insert, decorate table in PDF, extract tabular data
- [Working with Forms](/pdf/cpp/working-with-forms/) - deal with interact PDF documents, add formfields, extract data
- [Working with Graphs](/pdf/cpp/graphs/) - manipulate with shapes on the page
- [Annotations](/pdf/cpp/annotations/) - Annotations allow users to add custom content on PDF pages. You can add, delete and modify the annotation from the PDF documents.
- [Artifacts](/pdf/cpp/artifacts/) - deal with watermarks and other special objects in PDF
- [Metadata in PDFs](/pdf/cpp/pdf-file-metadata/) - get or set meta data in documents, dealing with XMP data.
- [Securing and Signing](/pdf/cpp/securing-and-signing/) - protect and sign your PDF document programmatically
- [Operators](/pdf/cpp/operators/) - make low-level operations in PDF
