PDF documents can be viewed and printed, but not always easily edited. However, the **Aspose.PDF for Python via C++ Library** will help you cope with even the most difficult task in working with PDF.

You are able to do the following:

- [Optimize PDF](/pdf/python-cpp/optimize-pdf/) - optimize page content, optimize file size, remove unused objects, compress all images for successful document optimization.
- [Merge PDF](/pdf/python-cpp/merge-pdf-documents/) - merge multiple PDF files into a single PDF document using Python.
- [Split PDF](/pdf/python-cpp/split-pdf-document/) - split PDF pages into individual PDF files in your Python applications.
