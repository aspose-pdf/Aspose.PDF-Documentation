**Advanced Operations** is a section about how to deals with existing PDF files programatically, be they documents created with Aspose.PDF as discussed in [Basic Operations](/pdf/python-cpp/basic-operations/), or PDFs created with Adobe Acrobat, Google Docs, Microsoft Office, Open Office or any other PDF producer.

Using Python to perform advanced operations with PDFs via a C++ library can be a powerful combination. Integrating Python with a C++ library allows for efficient and high-performance processing of PDF files. Aspose.PDF for Python via C++ is a popular choice due to its extensive features and performance.

This article explains how to implement your PDF needs at an advanced level by showcasing Code snippets:

- Merge multiple PDF files into a single document or split a PDF into individual pages.
- Split your PDF into individual files for the ability to share this file, reduce its size, or highlight the information you need.
- Encrypt or decrypt PDF documents for security purposes.
- Optimize PDF documents for high performance and efficiency.
- Work with pages in PDF documents. You can add pages to existing PDFs, rotate PDFs, or set page sizes with Python via C++.

By combining the flexibility and ease of use of Python with the performance and capabilities of a C++ library, you can unlock a wide range of advanced PDF operations for your applications. 

You'll learn different ways to:

- [Working with Documents](/pdf/python-cpp/working-with-documents/) - compress, split, and merge documents and make other operations with the whole document.
- [Working with Pages](/pdf/python-cpp/working-with-pages/) - add, move or remove, crop pages, add watermarks, stamps, and etc.
- [Encrypt, and Decrypt PDF](/pdf/python-cpp/encrypt-decrypt-pdf/) - encrypt, and decrypt PDFs using Python.
