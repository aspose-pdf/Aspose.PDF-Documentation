## What is a PDF File?

PDF stands for the Portable Document Format, used to display documents in an electronic form independent of the software, hardware or operating system they are viewed on. Originally developed by Adobe® Systems as a universally compatible file format based on the PostScript format, it has become an international de-facto standard for exchanging documents and information.

A PDF file displays the exact same content and layout no matter which operating system, device or software application it is viewed on.

The PDF format allows you to integrate various types of content – text, images and vector graphics, videos, animations, audio files, 3D models, interactive fields, hyperlinks, buttons, and etc.
