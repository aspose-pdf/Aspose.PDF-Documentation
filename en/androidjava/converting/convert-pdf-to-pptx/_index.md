We have an API named Aspose.Slides which offers the feature to create as well as manipulate PPT/PPTX presentations. This API also provides the feature to convert PPT/PPTX files to PDF format. In Aspose.PDF for Java, we have introduced a feature to transform PDF documents into PPTX format. During this conversion, the individual pages of the PDF file are converted to separate slides in the PPTX file.

During PDF to PPTX conversion, the text is rendered as Text where you can select/update it, instead of its rendered as an image. Please note that in order to convert PDF files to PPTX format, Aspose.PDF provides a class named PptxSaveOptions. An object of the [PptxSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/PptxSaveOptions) class is passed as a second argument to the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/Document).save(..) method.

Check next code snippet to resolve your tasks with conversion PDF to PowerPoint format:

```java
 public void convertPDFtoPowerPoint() {
        // Load PDF document
        try {
            document = new Document(inputStream);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            resultMessage.setText(e.getMessage());
            return;
        }

        // Instantiate ExcelSave Option object
        PptxSaveOptions pptxSaveOptions = new PptxSaveOptions();


        // Save the output in PPTX
        File xlsFileName = new File(fileStorage, "PDF-to-Powerpoint.pptx");
        try {
            // Save the file into PPTX format
            document.save(xlsFileName.toString(), pptxSaveOptions);
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
            resultMessage.setText(e.getMessage());
            return;
        }
        resultMessage.setText(R.string.success_message);
    }
