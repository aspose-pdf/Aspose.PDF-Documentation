## Convert EPUB to PDF

**Aspose.PDF for PHP** allows you simply convert EPUB files to PDF format.

<abbr title="electronic publication">EPUB</abbr> is a free and open e-book standard from the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). Files have the extension .epub. EPUB is designed for reflowable content, meaning that an EPUB reader can optimize text for a particular display device.

In order to convert EPUB files to PDF format, Aspose.PDF for PHP has a class named [EpubLoadOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/EpubLoadOptions) which is used to load source EPUB file. After that, the object is passed as an argument to [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/document) object initialization, as it helps the PDF rendering engine to determine the source document's input format.

The following code snippet shows the process of converting an EPUB file into PDF format.

1. Create a EPUB [LoadOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/epubloadoptions/).
1. Initialize [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf.class-use/document) object.
1. Save output PDF document.

```php
// Create a new instance of EpubLoadOptions
$loadOption = new EpubLoadOptions();

// Create a new Document object and load the EPUB file
$document = new Document($inputFile, $loadOption);

// Save the document as a PDF file
$document->save($outputFile);
```

## Convert PCL to PDF

<abbr title="Printer Command Language">PCL</abbr>  (Printer Command Language) is a Hewlett-Packard printer language developed to access standard printer features. PCL levels 1 through 5e/5c are command-based languages that use control sequences which are processed and interpreted in the order they are received. At a consumer level, PCL data streams are generated by a print driver. PCL output can also be easily generated by custom applications.

### Converting a PCL file into PDF format

To allow conversion from PCL to PDF, [Aspose.PDF for PHP](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/php-java) has the class [PclLoadOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/PclLoadOptions) which is used to initialize the [LoadOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/LoadOptions) object. This object is then passed as an argument during [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/com.aspose.pdf/document) object initialization and helps the PDF rendering engine to determine the source document's input format.

The following code snippet shows the process of converting a PCL file into PDF format.

```php
// Create a new instance of PclLoadOptions
$loadOption = new PclLoadOptions();

// Create a new instance of Document and load the PCL file
$document = new Document($inputFile, $loadOption);

// Save the document as a PDF file
$document->save($outputFile);
```

### Known Issues

1. Origin of text strings and images can slightly differ from the ones in a source PCL file if the print direction is not 0º. The same refers to vector images if coordinate system of vector plot is rotated (RO command preceded).
1. Origin of labels in vector images can be differ from the ones in a source PCL file if the labels are influenced by a sequence of commands: Label Origin (LO), Define Variable Text Path (DV), Absolute Direction (DI) or Relative Direction (DR).
1. A text can be incorrectly read if it must be rendered with Bitmap or TrueType soft (embedded) font, because currently these fonts are only partially supported (see exceptions in "Supported features table"). In this situation text can be correctly read only if character codes in a soft font corresponds to default ones. A style of the read text also can be differed from the one in source PCL file because it is not necessary to set style in soft font header.
1. If parsed PCL file contains Intellifont or Universal soft fonts, an exception will be thrown, because Intellifont and Universal font are not supported at all.
1. If parsed PCL file contains macros commands the result of parsing will strongly differ from the source file, because macros commands are not supported.

## Convert Text to PDF

**Aspose.PDF for PHP** provides the capability to convert Text files to PDF format. In this article, we demonstrate how easily and efficiently we can convert a text file to PDF using Aspose.PDF.

When you need to convert a Text file to PDF, initially read the source text file in some reader. We have used StringBuilder to read the Text file contents. Instantiate Document object and add a new page in the Pages collection. Create a new object of TextFragment and pass StringBuilder object to its constructor. Add a new paragraph in Paragraphs collection using TextFragment object and save the resultant PDF file using the Save method of Document class.
