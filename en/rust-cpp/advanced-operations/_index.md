**Advanced Operations** is a section about how to deals with existing PDF files programatically, be they documents created with Aspose.PDF as discussed in [Basic Operations](/pdf/rust-cpp/basic-operations/), or PDFs created with Adobe Acrobat, Google Docs, Microsoft Office, Open Office or any other PDF producer.

You'll learn different ways to:

- [Working with Documents](/pdf/rust-cpp/working-with-documents/) - compress, split, and merge documents and make other operations with the whole document.
- [Working with Pages](/pdf/rust-cpp/working-with-pages/) - add, move or remove, rotate pages.
- [Working with Text](/pdf/rust-cpp/working-with-text/) - add text into PDF using Aspose.PDF and Rust.
- [Securing and Signing](/pdf/rust-cpp/securing-and-signing/) - protect and sign your PDF document programmatically
