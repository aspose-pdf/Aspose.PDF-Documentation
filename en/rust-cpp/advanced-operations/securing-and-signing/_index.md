This section describes how to securely digitally sign PDF documents using Rust. The terms electronic signature and digital signature are used interchangeably, but essentially the two are different. More generally, a digital signature comes with a [certification authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) approved seal and is used to protect the signed document from tampering. Instead, an electronic signature is often used to demonstrate the intention to sign a document.
