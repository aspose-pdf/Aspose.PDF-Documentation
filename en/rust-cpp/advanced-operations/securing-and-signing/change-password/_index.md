## Change Password of a PDF File

If you want to change the password of a PDF file from "owner" to "newowner" try the next code snippet:

1. Select a PDF file.
1. Create a 'FileReader'.
1. The [AsposePdfChangePassword](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/rust-cpp/security/asposepdfchangepassword/) function is executed.
1. The name of the resulting file is set, in this example "ResultPdfChangePassword.pdf".
1. Next, if the 'json.errorCode' is 0, then your DownloadFile is given the name you specified earlier. If the 'json.errorCode' parameter is not equal to 0 and, accordingly, there will be an error in your file, then information about such an error will be contained in the 'json.errorText' file.
1. As a result, the [DownloadFile](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/rust-cpp/misc/downloadfile/) function generates a link and allows you to download the resulting file to the user's operating system.

```rs


```
