## Convert PDF to Image

In this article, we will show you the options for converting PDF to image formats.

Previously scanned documents are often saved in the PDF file format. However, do you need to edit it in a graphic editor or send it further in image format? We have a universal tool for you to convert PDF to images using **Aspose.PDF for Rust via C++**.
The most common task is when you need to save an entire PDF document or some specific pages of a document as a set of images. **Aspose.PDF for Rust via C++** allows you to convert PDF to JPG and PNG formats to simplify the steps required to get your images from a specific PDF file.

**Aspose.PDF for Rust via C++** supports various PDF to image formats conversion. Please checks the section [Aspose.PDF Supported File Formats](https://docs.aspose.com/pdf/rust-cpp/supported-file-formats/).

### Convert PDF to JPEG

The provided Rust code snippet demonstrates how to convert the first page of a PDF document into a JPEG image using the Aspose.PDF library:

1. Open a PDF document.
1. Convert a Page to JPEG using [page_to_jpg](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/rust-cpp/convert/page_to_jpg/) function.
1. Close the PDF document and release any allocated resources.

```rs

  use asposepdf::Document;

  fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
      // Open a PDF-document with filename
      let pdf = Document::open("sample.pdf")?;

      // Convert and save the specified page as Jpg-image
      pdf.page_to_jpg(1, 100, "sample_page1.jpg")?;

      Ok(())
  }
```
