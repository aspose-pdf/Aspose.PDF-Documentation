Repair PDFs are necessary for maintaining and enhancing PDF documents, especially when dealing with corrupted files or making adjustments. Repairing a PDF file and saving it as a new document is a common requirement in scenarios like document management systems, where file integrity is critical.

It includes error handling at every step, ensuring that any issues with opening, repairing, or saving the PDF document are logged and addressed promptly. This makes the code robust for real-world applications.

The example is simple and concise, making it easy to understand and implement. It is a clear starting point for developers new to using PDF libraries like Aspose.PDF for Rust.

**Aspose.PDF for Rust** allows high-quality PDF repair. The PDF file may not open for any reason, regardless of the program or browser. In some cases the document can be restored, try the following code and see for yourself.

1. Open a PDF document using [open](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/rust-cpp/core/open/) function.
1. Repair the PDF document with [repair](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/rust-cpp/organize/repair/) function.
1. Save the repaired PDF document using [save_as](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/rust-cpp/core/save_as/) method.

```rs

  use asposepdf::Document;

  fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
      // Open a PDF-document with filename
      let pdf = Document::open("sample.pdf")?;

      // Repair PDF-document
      pdf.repair()?;

      // Save the previously opened PDF-document with new filename
      pdf.save_as("sample_repair.pdf")?;

      Ok(())
  }
```
