## Installation

### Installation from Aspose website

This package includes a large file which is stored as a bzip2 archive.

1. **Download** the archive **Aspose.PDF for Rust via C++** from the official Aspose website.
   The latest (most recent) version is listed at the top and is downloaded by default when you click the **Download** button.
   It is recommended to use this latest version. Only download a previous version if needed.
   Example: `Aspose.PDF-for-Rust-via-CPP-25.6.zip`

   The archive filename format is: `Aspose.PDF-for-Rust-via-CPP-YY.M.zip`, where:
   - `YY` = last two digits of the year (e.g., `25` for 2025)
   - `M` = month number from `1` to `12`

2. **Extract** the archive to your chosen directory `{path}` using a suitable tool:
   - On Linux/macOS:
     ```bash
     unzip Aspose.PDF-for-Rust-via-CPP-YY.M.zip -d {path}
     ```
   - On Windows, use built-in Explorer extraction or any unzip tool (7-Zip, WinRAR).

3. **Add** the library as a dependency in your Rust project. You can do this in two ways:

   - **Using the command line:**
     ```bash
     cargo add asposepdf --path {path}/asposepdf
     ```

   - **Manually editing `Cargo.toml`:**
     Open your project's `Cargo.toml` and add the following under `[dependencies]`:
     ```toml
     [dependencies]
     asposepdf = { path = "{path}/asposepdf" }
     ```

4. **Build** your project (`cargo build`). On the first build, the dynamic library for your platform will be unpacked automatically from the `.bz2` archive in the `lib` folder. This may cause a short delay.

> **Notes**
> - The `lib` folder contains all platform-specific `.bz2` archives with corresponding `.sha256` checksum files.
> - If the checksum file is missing or invalid, the build will fail.
> - Update the library by replacing the extracted files with a newer archive version.

### Installation from GitHub

This package includes precompiled native libraries (`.dll`, `.so`, `.dylib`) which are stored as compressed `.bz2` archives inside the GitHub repository.

1. **Add** the library as a dependency in your Rust project. You can do this in two ways:

- **Using the command line:**

```bash
cargo add asposepdf --git https://github.com/aspose-pdf/aspose-pdf-rust-cpp.git
```

- **Manually editing `Cargo.toml`:**

Open your project's `Cargo.toml` and add the following under `[dependencies]`:

```toml
[dependencies]
asposepdf = { git = "https://github.com/aspose-pdf/aspose-pdf-rust-cpp.git" }
```

**Note:** To use a specific release version, you can specify a tag:
  
```toml
asposepdf = { git = "https://github.com/aspose-pdf/aspose-pdf-rust-cpp.git", tag = "v1.25.7" }
```

2. **Build** your project (`cargo build`). On the first build, the appropriate dynamic library for your platform will be automatically unpacked from the `.bz2` archive in the `lib` folder. This may cause a short delay.

**Notes**

- You do not need to manually download or extract any files â€” everything is included in the GitHub repository.
- All `.bz2` archives have matching `.sha256` checksum files. The checksum is verified before unpacking.
- If the checksum verification fails or the archive is missing, the build will fail with a detailed error.
- The build script links the appropriate native library and ensures runtime availability using platform-specific options.

### Installation from crates.io

This package is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/asposepdf) and includes a build script that automatically extracts the required native library (`.dll`, `.so`, or `.dylib`) from a compressed `.bz2` archive during the build process.

1. **Add** the library as a dependency in your Rust project. You can do this in two ways:

- **Using the command line:**

```bash
cargo add asposepdf
```

- **Manually editing `Cargo.toml`:**

Open your project's `Cargo.toml` and add the following under `[dependencies]`:

```toml
[dependencies]
asposepdf = "1.25.7"
```

**Note:** The crates.io package requires you to provide the native dynamic libraries yourself (the .dll, .so, .dylib files).

2. **Set the path** to the directory containing the native libraries and download the required files:

- **Set the environment variable `ASPOSE_PDF_LIB_DIR`** to point to the folder where you will place the native `.bz2` archives, their `.sha256` checksum files, and the extracted native libraries (`.dll`, `.so`, `.dylib`, and for Windows also `.lib`):

- On Linux/macOS:

```bash
export ASPOSE_PDF_LIB_DIR=/path/to/lib
```

- On Windows (Command Prompt):

```cmd
set ASPOSE_PDF_LIB_DIR=C:\path\to\lib
```

- On Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
$env:ASPOSE_PDF_LIB_DIR = "C:\path\to\lib"
```

- **Download the required `.bz2` archives** and checksum files from the GitHub repository's [`lib/` folder](https://github.com/aspose-pdf/aspose-pdf-rust-cpp/tree/main/lib) and **place them** into the folder set in `ASPOSE_PDF_LIB_DIR`:

- For **Linux x64**, download:
- `libAsposePDFforRust_linux_amd64.so.bz2`
- `libAsposePDFforRust_linux_amd64.so.bz2.sha256`

- For **macOS x86_64**, download:
- `libAsposePDFforRust_darwin_amd64.dylib.bz2`
- `libAsposePDFforRust_darwin_amd64.dylib.bz2.sha256`

- For **macOS arm64**, download:
- `libAsposePDFforRust_darwin_arm64.dylib.bz2`
- `libAsposePDFforRust_darwin_arm64.dylib.bz2.sha256`

- For **Windows x64**, download:
- `AsposePDFforRust_windows_amd64.dll.bz2`
- `AsposePDFforRust_windows_amd64.dll.bz2.sha256`
- `AsposePDFforRust_windows_amd64.lib` (native import library, not compressed)

**Note:**

You need to manually download these files from GitHub and place them into the directory pointed by `ASPOSE_PDF_LIB_DIR`.  
The build script will automatically unpack the native libraries from the `.bz2` archives on first build.

3. **Build** your project (`cargo build`). On the first build, the native library matching your platform will be automatically extracted and linked. This step may take a few seconds.

**Notes**

- You must provide the folder containing the `.bz2` and `.sha256` files separately, as these binary archives are not distributed via crates.io.
- If the required archive is missing or the checksum fails, the build will fail with a detailed error.
- The same binary files used for installation via GitHub or the Aspose website can be reused here.
