## Convert PDF to EPUB

**<abbr title="Electronic Publication">EPUB</abbr>** is a free and open e-book standard from the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). Files have the extension .epub.
EPUB is designed for reflowable content, meaning that an EPUB reader can optimize text for a particular display device. EPUB also supports fixed-layout content. The format is intended as a single format that publishers and conversion houses can use in-house, as well as for distribution and sale. It supersedes the Open eBook standard.

The provided Go code snippet demonstrates how to convert a PDF document into a EPUB using the Aspose.PDF library:

1. Open a PDF document.
1. Convert a PDF file to EPUB using [SaveEpub]() function.
1. Close the PDF document and release any allocated resources.

```go

    package main

    import "github.com/aspose-pdf/aspose-pdf-go-cpp"
    import "log"

    func main() {
      // Open(filename string) opens a PDF-document with filename
      pdf, err := asposepdf.Open("sample.pdf")
      if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
      }
      // SaveEpub(filename string) saves previously opened PDF-document as Epub-document with filename
      err = pdf.SaveEpub("sample.epub")
      if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
      }
      // Close() releases allocated resources for PDF-document
      defer pdf.Close()
    }
```

      pdf, err := asposepdf.Open("sample.pdf")
      if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
      }
      // SaveTeX(filename string) saves previously opened PDF-document as TeX-document with filename
      err = pdf.SaveTeX("sample.tex")
      if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
      }
      // Close() releases allocated resources for PDF-document
      defer pdf.Close()

## Convert PDF to XPS

The XPS file type is primarily associated with the XML Paper Specification by Microsoft Corporation. The XML Paper Specification (XPS), formerly codenamed Metro and subsuming the Next Generation Print Path (NGPP) marketing concept, is Microsoft's initiative to integrate document creation and viewing into the Windows operating system.

**Aspose.PDF for Go** gives a possibility to convert PDF files to <abbr title="XML Paper Specification">XPS</abbr> format. Let try to use the presented code snippet for converting PDF files to XPS format with Go.

The provided Go code snippet demonstrates how to convert a PDF document into a XPS using the Aspose.PDF library:

1. Open a PDF document.
1. Convert a PDF file to XPS using [SaveXps](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/go-cpp/convert/savexps/) function.
1. Close the PDF document and release any allocated resources.

```go

    package main

    import "github.com/aspose-pdf/aspose-pdf-go-cpp"
    import "log"

    func main() {
      // Open(filename string) opens a PDF-document with filename
      pdf, err := asposepdf.Open("sample.pdf")
      if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
      }
      // SaveXps(filename string) saves previously opened PDF-document as Xps-document with filename
      err = pdf.SaveXps("sample.xps")
      if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
      }
      // Close() releases allocated resources for PDF-document
      defer pdf.Close()
    }
```

## Convert PDF to Grayscale PDF

The provided Go code snippet demonstrates how to convert the first page of a PDF document into a Grayscale PDF using the Aspose.PDF library:

1. Open a PDF document.
1. Convert a PDF Page to Grayscale PDF using [PageGrayscale](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/go-cpp/organize/pagegrayscale/) function.
1. Close the PDF document and release any allocated resources.

This example converts a specific page of your PDF to Grayscale:

```go

    package main

    import "github.com/aspose-pdf/aspose-pdf-go-cpp"
    import "log"

    func main() {
      // Open(filename string) opens a PDF-document with filename
      pdf, err := asposepdf.Open("sample.pdf")
      if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
      }
      // PageGrayscale(num int32) converts page to black and white
      err = pdf.PageGrayscale(1)
      if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
      }
      // SaveAs(filename string) saves previously opened PDF-document with new filename
      err = pdf.SaveAs("sample_page1_Grayscale.pdf")
      if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
      }
      // Close() releases allocated resources for PDF-document
      defer pdf.Close()
    }
```

This example will convert the entire PDF document to Grayscale:

```go

    package main

    import "github.com/aspose-pdf/aspose-pdf-go-cpp"
    import "log"

    func main() {
      // Open(filename string) opens a PDF-document with filename
      pdf, err := asposepdf.Open("sample.pdf")
      if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
      }
      // Grayscale() converts PDF-document to black and white
      err = pdf.Grayscale()
      if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
      }
      // SaveAs(filename string) saves previously opened PDF-document with new filename
      err = pdf.SaveAs("sample_Grayscale.pdf")
      if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
      }
      // Close() releases allocated resources for PDF-document
      defer pdf.Close()
    }
```
