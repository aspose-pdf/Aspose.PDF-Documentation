## Aspose.PDF for Go via C++

_This page is an overview of  Aspose.PDF for Go features._

Go, often called Golang, is a modern programming language developed by Google to address challenges faced in scalable and efficient software development. Created in 2009 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson, Go blends simplicity, speed, and reliability, making it a favorite among developers.

The Go language includes beneficial features like garbage collection, strong typing, and concurrency mechanisms such as goroutines and channels. These features enable developers to write robust applications that efficiently handle multiple tasks simultaneously, which is crucial for cloud-based services and web servers.

Go's popularity stems from its ease, minimalistic design, and seamless scalability. Its compilation speed is exceptional, producing highly optimized binaries, which reduce runtime overhead. With a growing ecosystem, including tools and libraries, Go is widely adopted in domains like microservices, DevOps, and big data.

The language also emphasizes community-driven development, fostering collaboration among developers. Go's pragmatic approach to coding and focus on performance make it ideal for modern, high-performance applications.

Go has been popular since 2018, and it is the most popular language developers would like to add to their stack.
