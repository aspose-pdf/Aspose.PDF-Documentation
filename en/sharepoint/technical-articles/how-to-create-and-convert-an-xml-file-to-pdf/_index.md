According to Aspose.PDF for .NET DOM, a PDF document contains a collection of Section objects, and a Section contains one or more Paragraph elements. Text is a Paragraph level object and may contain one or more segments. Below, a sample text string is added to a Segment object and added to a Text object. Finally, the Text element is added to the Section object's paragraphs collection.

**XML**

{{< highlight csharp >}}



<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>

  <Pdf xmlns="Aspose.PDF">

   <Section>

    <Text>

            <Segment>Hello World</Segment>

    </Text>

   </Section>

  </Pdf>



{{< /highlight >}}
