Merging/concatenating of multiple PDF files into a single PDF file is very popular and demanding feature in PDF file processing applications. We have introduced this important feature in [Aspose.PDF for SharePoint 2.2.0](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/sharepoint/new-releases/aspose.pdf-for-sharepoint-2.2.0/) version. Merging two files is, creating a single file by adding second file to the end of first file.
