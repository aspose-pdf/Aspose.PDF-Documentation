## Introduction to Aspose.PDF Java for PHP

### PHP / Java Bridge

The PHP/Java Bridge is an implementation of a streaming, XML-based [network protocol](http://php-java-bridge.sourceforge.net/pjb/PROTOCOL.TXT), which can be used to connect a native script engine, for example PHP, Scheme or Python, with a Java virtual machine. It is up to 50 times faster than local RPC via SOAP, requires less resources on the web-server side. It is [faster](http://php-java-bridge.sourceforge.net/pjb/FAQ.html#performance) and more reliable than direct communication via the Java Native Interface, and it requires no additional components to invoke Java procedures from PHP or PHP procedures from Java.

### How to configure the source code on Linux Platform

Please follow these simple steps in order to open and extend the source code while using:

### 1. Install Tomcat Server

To install tomcat server, issue following command on the linux console. This will successfully install tomcat server.

{{< highlight actionscript3 >}}

 sudo apt-get install tomcat8

{{< /highlight >}}

### 2. Download and Configure PHP/JavaBridge

In order to download the PHP/JavaBridge binaries, issue following command on the linux console.

{{< highlight actionscript3 >}}

  wget http://citylan.dl.sourceforge.net/project/php-java-bridge/Binary%20package/php-java-bridge_6.2.1/php-java-bridge_6.2.1_documentation.zip

{{< /highlight >}}

Unzip the PHP/JavaBridge binaries by issuing the following command on linux console.

{{< highlight actionscript3 >}}

  unzip -d php-java-bridge_6.2.1_documentation.zip

{{< /highlight >}}


This will extract **JavaBridge.war** file. Copy it to tomcat88 **webapps** folder by issuing the following command on Linux console.

{{< highlight actionscript3 >}}

  sudo cp JavaBridge.war /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/JavaBridge.war

{{< /highlight >}}

By copying, tomcat8 will automatically create a new folder "**JavaBridge**" in **webapps**.

If any error message appears then install  **FastCGI** by issuing the following command on Linux console.

{{< highlight actionscript3 >}}

  sudo apt-get install php55-cgi

{{< /highlight >}}


If **JAVA_HOME** error is displayed, then open /etc/default/tomcat8 file and uncomment the line that sets the JAVA_HOME.
