**What are annotations in PDF documents?**

These are additional objects that you add to your file to expand the content of the text, make edits, comments for other users. It is also possible to make the text in the document more readable, highlight it, underline it or add completely new text.

We have combined the different kinds of annotation available for the Aspose.PDF for Java  library into groups:

- [PDF Text Annotation](/pdf/java/text-annotation/)
- [PDF Highlights Annotation](/pdf/java/highlights-annotation/)
- [PDF Figures Annotation](/pdf/java/figures-annotation/)
- [Multimedia Annotation](/pdf/java/multimedia-annotation/)
- [PDF sticky Annotations](/pdf/java/sticky-annotations/)
- [Extra Annotations](/pdf/java/extra-annotations/)
