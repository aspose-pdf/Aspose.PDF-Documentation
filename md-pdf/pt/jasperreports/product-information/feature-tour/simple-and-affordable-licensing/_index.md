Aspose.PDF for JasperReports evaluation and paid versions are the same download. The trial version provides the same features as the licensed version, with the exception that it inserts an evaluation watermark in the output PDF document. You can [download Aspose.PDF for JasperReports](http://www.aspose.com/community/files/67/jasperreports-exporters/aspose.pdf-for-jasperreports/default.aspx) and install it. It works in evaluation mode automatically.

Please take an advantage of the evaluation version of Aspose.PDF for JasperReports: it does not have time limitations and comes with free technical support.

Evaluation mode injects watermarks into exported reports. When you [buy a license](http://www.aspose.com/community/forums/aspose.purchase/220/showforum.aspx), [simply apply the license](/pdf/jasperreports/licensing/) and watermark will no more appear in the output documents.
