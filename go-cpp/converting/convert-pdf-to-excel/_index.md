## Convert PDF to XLSX

Excel provides advanced tools for sorting, filtering, and analyzing data, making it easier to perform tasks like trend analysis or financial modeling, which are difficult with static PDF files. Manually copying data from PDFs into Excel is time-consuming and error-prone. Conversion automates this process, saving significant time for large datasets.

Aspose.PDF for Go uses [SaveXlsX](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/go-cpp/convert/savexlsx/) to convert the downloaded PDF file into an Excel spreadsheet and save it.

1. Import Required Packages.
1. Open a PDF File.
1. Convert the PDF to XLSX using [SaveXlsX](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/go-cpp/convert/savexlsx/).
1. Close the PDF Document.

```go

  package main

  import "github.com/aspose-pdf/aspose-pdf-go-cpp"
  import "log"

  func main() {
    // Open(filename string) opens a PDF-document with filename
    pdf, err := asposepdf.Open("sample.pdf")
    if err != nil {
      log.Fatal(err)
    }
    // SaveXlsX(filename string) saves previously opened PDF-document as XlsX-document with filename
    err = pdf.SaveXlsX("sample.xlsx")
    if err != nil {
      log.Fatal(err)
    }
    // Close() releases allocated resources for PDF-document
    defer pdf.Close()
  }
```
