## Convert EPUB to PDF

**Aspose.PDF for .NET** allows you simply convert EPUB files to PDF format.

<abbr title="electronic publication">EPUB</abbr> (short for electronic publication) is a free and open e-book standard from the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). Files have the extension .epub. EPUB is designed for reflowable content, meaning that an EPUB reader can optimize text for a particular display device.

EPUB also supports fixed-layout content. The format is intended as a single format that publishers and conversion houses can use in-house, as well as for distribution and sale. It supersedes the Open eBook standard.The version EPUB 3 is also endorsed by the Book Industry Study Group (BISG), a leading book trade association for standardized best practices, research, information and events, for packaging of content.

Conversion steps:

1. Create an instance of [EpubLoadOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/epubloadoptions) class.
1. Create an instance of [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) class with mention source filename and options.
1. Save the document with the desired file name.

Next following code snippet show you how to convert EPUB files to PDF format with C#.

```csharp
public static void ConvertEPUBtoPDF()
{
    EpubLoadOptions option = new EpubLoadOptions();
    Document pdfDocument= new Document(_dataDir + "WebAssembly.epub", option);
    pdfDocument.Save(_dataDir + "epub_test.pdf");
}
```

You can also set page size for conversion. To define new page size you `SizeF` object and pass it to [EpubLoadOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/epubloadoptions/constructors/main) constructor.

```csharp
public static void ConvertEPUBtoPDFAdv()
{
    EpubLoadOptions option = new EpubLoadOptions(new SizeF(1190, 1684));
    Document pdfDocument= new Document(_dataDir + "WebAssembly.epub", option);
    pdfDocument.Save(_dataDir + "epub_test.pdf");
}
```

## Convert Markdown to PDF

**This feature is supported by version 19.6 or greater.**

**Try to convert Markdown to PDF online**

Aspose.PDF for .NET presents you online free application ["Markdown to PDF"](https://products.aspose.app/pdf/conversion/md-to-pdf), where you may try to investigate the functionality and quality it works.

[![Aspose.PDF Convertion Markdown to PDF with Free App](markdown.png)](https://products.aspose.app/pdf/conversion/md-to-pdf)
{{% /alert %}}

Aspose.PDF for .NET provides the functionality to create a PDF document based on input [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) data file. In order to convert the Markdown to PDF, you need to initialize the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/document) using [MdLoadOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/mdloadoptions).

The following code snippet shows how to use this functionality with Aspose.PDF library:

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf_DocumentConversion();
// Open Markdown document
Document pdfDocument= new Document(dataDir + "sample.md", new MdLoadOptions());
// Save document in PDF format
pdfDocument.Save(dataDir + "MarkdownToPDF.pdf");
```

## Convert PCL to PDF

<abbr title="Printer Command Language">PCL</abbr> (Printer Command Language) is a Hewlett-Packard printer language developed to access standard printer features. PCL levels 1 through 5e/5c are command based languages using control sequences that are processed and interpreted in the order they are received. At a consumer level, PCL data streams are generated by a print driver. PCL output can also be easily generated by custom applications.

### Converting a PCL file into PDF format

To allow conversion from PCL to PDF, Aspose.PDF has the class [`PclLoadOptions`](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/pclloadoptions) which is used to initialize the LoadOptions object. Later on this object is passed as an argument during Document object initialization and it helps the PDF rendering engine to determine the input format of source document.

The following code snippet shows the process of converting a PCL file into PDF format.

```csharp
public static void ConvertPCLtoPDF()
{
    PclLoadOptions options = new PclLoadOptions();
    Document pdfDocument= new Document(_dataDir + "demo.pcl", options);
    pdfDocument.Save(_dataDir + "pcl_test.pdf");
}
```

You can also monitor the detection of errors during the conversion process. To do this, you need to configure PclLoadOptions object: set or unset SupressErrors.

```csharp
public static void ConvertPCLtoPDFAvdanced()
{
    PclLoadOptions options = new PclLoadOptions { SupressErrors = true };
    Document pdfDocument= new Document(_dataDir + "demo.pcl", options);
    if (options.Exceptions!=null)
        foreach (var ex in options.Exceptions)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
        }
    pdfDocument.Save(_dataDir + "pcl_test.pdf");
}
```

### Known Issues

1. Origin of text strings and images can be slightly differed from the ones in a sorce PCL file If print direction is not 0°. The same refers to vector images if coordinate system of vector plot is rotated (RO command preceded).
1. Origin of labels in vector images can be differ from the ones in a sorce PCL file If the labels are influenced by a sequence of commands: Label Origin (LO), Define Variable Text Path (DV), Absolute Direction (DI) or Relative Direction (DR).
1. A text can be incorrectly read if it must be rendered with Bitmap or TrueType soft (embedded) font, because currently these fonts are only partially supported (See exceptions in "Supported features table"). In this situation text can be correctly read only if character codes in a soft font corresponds to default ones. A style of the read text also can be differed from the one in source PCL file because it is not necessary to set style in soft font header.
1. If parsed PCL file contains Intellifont or Universal soft fonts exception will be thrown, because Intellifont and Universal font are not supported at all.
1. If parsed PCL file contains macros commands the result of parsing will strongly differ from the source file, because macros commands are not supported.

## Convert Text to PDF

**Aspose.PDF for .NET** support the feature converting plain text and pre-formatted text file to PDF format.

Converting text to PDF means adding text fragments to the PDF page. As for text files, we are dealing with 2 types of text: pre-formatting (for example, 25 lines with 80 characters per line) and non-formatted text (plain text). Depending on our needs, we can control this addition ourselves or entrust it to the library's algorithms.

{{% /alert %}}

### Convert plain text file to PDF

In case of the plain text file, we can use the following technique:

1. use a TextReader to read the whole text;
1. instantiate Document object and add a new page in Pages collection;
1. create a new object of TextFragment and pass TextReader object to its constructor;
1. add TextFragment object as paragraph in Paragraphs collection. If the amount of text is larger than the page, library algorithm automatically adds extra pages;
1. use Save method of Document class;

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf_DocumentConversion();
// Read the source text file
TextReader tr = new StreamReader(dataDir + "log.txt");

// Instantiate a Document object by calling its empty constructor
Document pdfDocument= new Document();

// Add a new page in Pages collection of Document
Page page = pdfDocument.Pages.Add();

// Create an instance of TextFragmet and pass the text from reader object to its constructor as argument
TextFragment text = new TextFragment(tr.ReadToEnd());

// Add a new text paragraph in paragraphs collection and pass the TextFragment object
page.Paragraphs.Add(text);

// Save resultant PDF file
pdfDocument.Save(dataDir + "TexttoPDF_out.pdf");
```

### Convert pre-formatted text file to PDF

Converting pre-formatted text is like plain text but you need to make some additional actions such as setting margins, font type and size. Obviously that font should be monospace (for example Courier New).

Follow these steps to convert pre-formatted text to PDF with C#:

1. Read the whole text as an array of strings;
1. Instantiate Document object and add a new page in Pages collection;
1. Run loop through an array of strings and add each string as a paragraph in Paragraph collection

In this case, the library's algorithm also adds extra pages, but we can control this process ourselves.
Following example shows how to convert pre-formatted text file (80x25) to PDF document with page size A4.

```csharp
public static void ConvertPreFormattedTextToPdf()
{
    // Read the text file as array of string
    var lines = System.IO.File.ReadAllLines(_dataDir + "rfc822.txt");

    // Instantiate a Document object by calling its empty constructor
    Document pdfDocument= new Document();

    // Add a new page in Pages collection of Document
    Page page = pdfDocument.Pages.Add();

    // Set left and right margins for better presentation
    page.PageInfo.Margin.Left = 20;
    page.PageInfo.Margin.Right = 10;
    page.PageInfo.DefaultTextState.Font = FontRepository.FindFont("Courier New");
    page.PageInfo.DefaultTextState.FontSize = 12;

    foreach (var line in lines)
    {
        // check if line contains "form feed" character
        // see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_break
        if (line.StartsWith("\x0c"))
        {
            page = pdfDocument.Pages.Add();
            page.PageInfo.Margin.Left = 20;
            page.PageInfo.Margin.Right = 10;
            page.PageInfo.DefaultTextState.Font = FontRepository.FindFont("Courier New");
            page.PageInfo.DefaultTextState.FontSize = 12;
        }
        else
        {
            // Create an instance of TextFragment and
            // pass the line to its
            // constructor as argument
            TextFragment text = new TextFragment(line);

            // Add a new text paragraph in paragraphs collection and pass the TextFragment object
            page.Paragraphs.Add(text);
        }
    }

    // Save resultant PDF file
    pdfDocument.Save(_dataDir + "TexttoPDF_out.pdf");
}
```

## Convert XPS to PDF

**Aspose.PDF for .NET** support feature converting <abbr title="XML Paper Specification">XPS</abbr> files to PDF format. Check this article to resolve your tasks.

The XPS file type is primarily associated with the XML Paper Specification by Microsoft Corporation. The XML Paper Specification (XPS), formerly codenamed Metro and subsuming the Next Generation Print Path (NGPP) marketing concept, is Microsoft's initiative to integrate document creation and viewing into its Windows operating system.

{{% alert color="primary" %}}

The file format is basically a zipped XML file which is primarily used for distribution and storage. It's very difficult to edit and mostly implemented by Microsoft.

{{% /alert %}}

In order to convert XPS to PDF with Aspose.PDF for .NET, we have introduced a class named [XpsLoadOption](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/xpsloadoptions) which is used to initialize a [LoadOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/loadoptions) object. Later, this object is passed as an argument during the Document object initialization and it helps the PDF rendering engine to determine the source document's input format.

{{% alert color="primary" %}}

In both XP and Windows 7, you should find an XPS Printer pre-installed if you look in the Control Panel and then Printers. To create these files you can use that printer for the output device. In Windows 7, you should be able to just double-click the file to open it in a XPS viewer. You may also download XPS viewer from Microsoft's website.

{{% /alert %}}

The following code snippet shows the process of converting XPS file into PDF format with C#.

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf_DocumentConversion();

// Instantiate LoadOption object using XPS load option
Aspose.Pdf.LoadOptions options = new XpsLoadOptions();

// Create document object
Aspose.Pdf.Document pdfDocument = new Aspose.Pdf.Document(dataDir + "XPSToPDF.xps", options);

// Save the resultant PDF document

## Convert PostScript to PDF

**Aspose.PDF for .NET** support features converting PostScript files to PDF format. One of the features from Aspose.PDF is that you can set a set of font folders to be used during conversion.

In order to convert a PostScript file to PDF format, Aspose.PDF for .NET offers [PsLoadOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/psloadoptions) class which is used to initialize the LoadOptions object. Later this object can be passed as an argument to Document object constructor, which will help PDF Rendering Engine to determine the format of source document.

Following code snippet can be used to convert a PostScript file into PDF format with Aspose.PDF for .NET:

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET
// The path to the documents directory.
string _dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf_DocumentConversion();
// Create a new instance of PsLoadOptions
PsLoadOptions options = new PsLoadOptions();
// Open .ps document with created load options
Document pdfDocument = new Document(_dataDir + "input.ps", options);
// Save document
pdfDocument.Save(dataDir + "PSToPDF.pdf");
```

Additionally, you can set a set of font folders that will be used during conversion:

```csharp
public static void ConvertPostscriptToPDFAvdanced()
{
    PsLoadOptions options = new PsLoadOptions
    {
        FontsFolders = new [] { @"c:\tmp\fonts1", @"c:\tmp\fonts2"}
    };
    Document pdfDocument = new Document(_dataDir + "input.ps", options);
    pdfDocument.Save(_dataDir + "ps_test.pdf");
}
```

## Convert XSL-FO to PDF

The conversion of XSL-FO files to PDF can be implemented using the traditional Aspose.PDF technique - instantiate [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/page/net/aspose.page/document) object with [XslFoLoadOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/xslfoloadoptions). But sometimes you can meet with the incorrect file structure. For this case, XSL-FO converter allows setting the error handling strategy. You can choose `ThrowExceptionImmediately`, `TryIgnore` or `InvokeCustomHandler`.

```csharp
public static void Convert_XSLFO_to_PDF()
{
    // Instantiate XslFoLoadOption object
    var options = new XslFoLoadOptions(".\\samples\\employees.xslt");
    // Set error handling strategy
    options.ParsingErrorsHandlingType = XslFoLoadOptions.ParsingErrorsHandlingTypes.ThrowExceptionImmediately;
    // Create Document object
    var pdfDocument = new Aspose.Pdf.Document(".\\samples\\employees.xml", options);
    pdfDocument.Save(_dataDir + "data_xml.pdf");
}
```

## Convert LaTeX/TeX to PDF
