<abbr title="Printer Command Language">PCL</abbr> (Printer Command Language) is a Hewlett-Packard printer language developed to access standard printer features. PCL levels 1 through 5e/5c are command based languages using control sequences that are processed and interpreted in the order they are received. At a consumer level, PCL data streams are generated by a print driver. PCL output can also be easily generated by custom applications.

## Live Example

Aspose.PDF for for .NET presents you online free application ["PCL to PDF"](https://products.aspose.app/pdf/conversion/pcl-to-pdf), where you may try to investigate the functionality and quality it works.

**Currently only PCL5 and older versions are supported**

## Converting a PCL file into PDF format

To allow conversion from PCL to PDF, Aspose.PDF has the class [`PclLoadOptions`](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/pclloadoptions) which is used to initialize the LoadOptions object. Later on this object is passed as an argument during Document object initialization and it helps the PDF rendering engine to determine the input format of source document.

The following code snippet shows the process of converting a PCL file into PDF format.

```csharp
public static void ConvertPCLtoPDF()
{
    PclLoadOptions options = new PclLoadOptions();
    Document pdfDocument= new Document(_dataDir + "demo.pcl", options);
    pdfDocument.Save(_dataDir + "pcl_test.pdf");
}
```

You can also monitor the detection of errors during the conversion process. To do this, you need to configure PclLoadOptions object: set or unset SupressErrors.

```csharp
public static void ConvertPCLtoPDFAvdanced()
{
    PclLoadOptions options = new PclLoadOptions { SupressErrors = true };
    Document pdfDocument= new Document(_dataDir + "demo.pcl", options);
    if (options.Exceptions!=null)
        foreach (var ex in options.Exceptions)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
        }
    pdfDocument.Save(_dataDir + "pcl_test.pdf");
}
```

## Known Issues

1. Origin of text strings and images can be slightly differed from the ones in a sorce PCL file If print direction is not 0°. The same refers to vector images if coordinate system of vector plot is rotated (RO command preceded).
1. Origin of labels in vector images can be differ from the ones in a sorce PCL file If the labels are influenced by a sequence of commands: Label Origin (LO), Define Variable Text Path (DV), Absolute Direction (DI) or Relative Direction (DR).
1. A text can be incorrectly read if it must be rendered with Bitmap or TrueType soft (embedded) font, because currently these fonts are only partially supported (See exceptions in "Supported features table"). In this situation text can be correctly read only if character codes in a soft font corresponds to default ones. A style of the read text also can be differed from the one in source PCL file because it is not necessary to set style in soft font header.
1. If parsed PCL file contains Intellifont or Universal soft fonts exception will be thrown, because Intellifont and Universal font are not supported at all.
1. If parsed PCL file contains macros commands the result of parsing will strongly differ from the source file, because macros commands are not supported.
