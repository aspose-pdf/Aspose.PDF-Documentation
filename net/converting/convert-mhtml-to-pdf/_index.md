<abbr title="MIME encapsulation of aggregate HTML documents">MHTML</abbr>, short for MIME HTML, is a web page archive format used to combine resources that are typically represented by external links (such as images, Flash animations, Java applets, and audio files) with HTML code into a single file. The content of an MHTML file is encoded as if it were an HTML email message, using the MIME type multipart/related. Aspose.PDF for .NET can convert HTML files to PDF format and with the release of Aspose.PDF for .NET 9.0.0, we have introduced a new feature that lets you convert MHTML files to PDF format. Next code snippet show how to covert MHTML files to PDF format with C#:

```csharp
public static void ConvertMHTtoPDF()
{
    MhtLoadOptions options = new MhtLoadOptions()
    {
        PageInfo = { Width = 842, Height = 1191, IsLandscape = true}
    };
    Document pdfDocument= new Document(_dataDir + "fileformatinfo.mht", options);
    pdfDocument.Save(_dataDir + "mhtml_test.PDF");
}
```
