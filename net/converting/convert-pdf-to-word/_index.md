One of the most popular features is the PDF to Microsoft Word DOC conversion, which makes content management easier. **Aspose.PDF for .NET** allows you to convert PDF files not only to DOC but also to DOCX format, easily and efficiently.

## Convert PDF to DOC (Word 97-2003) file

Convert PDF file to DOC format with ease and full control. Aspose.PDF for .NET is flexible and supports a wide variety of conversions. Converting pages from PDF documents to images, for example, is a very popular feature.

A conversion that many of our customers have requested is PDF to DOC: converting a PDF file to a Microsoft Word document. Customers want this because PDF files cannot easily be edited, whereas Word documents can. Some companies want their users to be able to manipulate text, tables and images in files that started as PDFs.

Keeping alive the tradition of making things simple and understandable, Aspose.PDF for .NET lets you transform a source PDF file into a DOC file with two lines of code. To accomplish this feature, we have introduced an enumeration named SaveFormat and its value .Doc lets you save the source file to Microsoft Word format.

The following code snippet shows the process of converting PDF file into DOC.

```csharp
public static void ConvertPDFtoWord()
{
    // Open the source PDF document
    Document pdfDocument = new Document(_dataDir + "PDFToDOC.pdf");
    // Save the file into MS document format
    pdfDocument.Save(_dataDir + "PDFToDOC_out.doc", SaveFormat.Doc);

}
```

### Using the DocSaveOptions Class

The [`DocSaveOptions`](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/docsaveoptions) class provides numerous properties that improve the process of converting PDF files to DOC format. Among these properties, Mode enables you to specify the recognition mode for PDF content. You can specify any value from the RecognitionMode enumeration for this property. Each of these values has specific benefits and limitations:

- [`Textbox`](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.docsaveoptions/recognitionmode) mode is fast and good for preserving the original look of the PDF file, but the editability of the resulting document could be limited. Every visually grouped block of text in the original PDF is converted into a textbox in the output document. This achieves maximal resemblance to the original so the output document looks good, but it consists entirely of textboxes and it could make editing in Microsoft Word quite hard.
- [`Flow`](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.docsaveoptions/recognitionmode) is full recognition mode, where the engine performs grouping and multi-level analysis to restore the original document as per the author's intent while producing an easily editable document. The limitation is that the output document might look different from the original.
- The [`RelativeHorizontalProximity`](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/docsaveoptions/properties/relativehorizontalproximity) property can be used to control the relative proximity between textual elements and means that distance is normed by the font size. Larger fonts may have bigger distances between syllables and still be looked at as a single whole. It is specified as a percentage of the font size, for example, 1 = 100%. This means that two characters of 12pt that are placed 12 pt apart are proximal.
- [`RecognitionBullets`](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/docsaveoptions/properties/recognizebullets) is used to switch on the recognition of bullets during conversion.

```csharp
public static void ConvertPDFtoWordDocAdvanced()
{
    var pdfFile = Path.Combine(_dataDir, "PDF-to-DOC.pdf");
    var docFile = Path.Combine(_dataDir, "PDF-to-DOC.doc");
    Document pdfDocument = new Document(pdfFile);
    DocSaveOptions saveOptions = new DocSaveOptions
    {
        Format = DocSaveOptions.DocFormat.Doc,
        // Set the recognition mode as Flow
        Mode = DocSaveOptions.RecognitionMode.Flow,
        // Set the Horizontal proximity as 2.5
        RelativeHorizontalProximity = 2.5f,
        // Enable the value to recognize bullets during conversion process
        RecognizeBullets = true
    };
    pdfDocument.Save(docFile, saveOptions);
}
```

## Convert PDF to DOCX

Aspose.PDF for .NET API lets you read and convert PDF documents to DOCX using C# and any .NET language. DOCX is a well-known format for Microsoft Word documents whose structure was changed from plain binary to a combination of XML and binary files. Docx files can be opened with Word 2007 and lateral versions but not with the earlier versions of MS Word which support DOC file extensions.

For quick conversion use `Save()` method with `SaveFormat.DocX` options:

```csharp
public static void ConvertPDFtoWord_DOCX_Format()
{
    // Open the source PDF document
    Document pdfDocument = new Document(_dataDir + "PDFToDOC.pdf");
    // Save the resultant DOC file
    pdfDocument.Save(_dataDir + "saveOptionsOutput_out.doc", SaveFormat.DocX);
}
```

The [`DocSaveOptions`](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/docsaveoptions) class has a property named Format which provides the capability to specify the format of the resultant document, that is, DOC or DOCX. In order to convert a PDF file to DOCX format, please pass the Docx value from the DocSaveOptions.DocFormat enumeration.

Please take a look over the following code snippet which provides the capability to convert PDF file to DOCX format with C#.

```csharp
public static void ConvertPDFtoWord_Advanced_DOCX_Format()
{
    // For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET
    // Open the source PDF document
    Document pdfDocument = new Document(_dataDir + "PDFToDOC.pdf");

    // Instantiate DocSaveOptions object
    DocSaveOptions saveOptions = new DocSaveOptions
    {
        // Specify the output format as DOCX
        Format = DocSaveOptions.DocFormat.DocX
        // Set other DocSaveOptions params
        // ....
    };
    // Save document in docx format
    pdfDocument.Save("ConvertToDOCX_out.docx", saveOptions);
}
```
