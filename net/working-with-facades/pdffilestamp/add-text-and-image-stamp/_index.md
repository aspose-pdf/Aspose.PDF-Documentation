## Add Text Stamp on All Pages in a PDF File

[PdfFileStamp](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdffilestamp) class allows you to add text stamp on all the pages of a PDF file. In order to add text stamp, you first need to create objects of [PdfFileStamp](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdffilestamp) and [Stamp](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/stamp) classes. You also need to create the text stamp using [BindLogo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/stamp/methods/bindlogo) method of [Stamp](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/stamp) class. You can set other attributes like origin, rotation, background etc. using [Stamp](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/stamp) object as well. Then you can add the stamp in the PDF file using [AddStamp](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdffilestamp/methods/addstamp) method of [PdfFileStamp](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdffilestamp) class. Finally, save the output PDF file using [Close](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/facade/methods/close) method of [PdfFileStamp](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdffilestamp) class. The following code snippet shows you how to add text stamp on all pages in a PDF file.

```csharp
 public static void AddTextStampOnAllPagesInPdfFile()
        {
            // Create PdfFileStamp object
            PdfFileStamp fileStamp = new PdfFileStamp();

            // Open Document
            fileStamp.BindPdf(_dataDir + "sample.pdf");

            // Create stamp
            Stamp stamp = new Stamp();
            stamp.BindLogo(new FormattedText("Hello World!", System.Drawing.Color.Blue, System.Drawing.Color.Gray, Aspose.Pdf.Facades.FontStyle.Helvetica, EncodingType.Winansi, true, 14));
            stamp.SetOrigin(10, 400);
            stamp.Rotation = 90.0F;
            stamp.IsBackground = true;

            // Add stamp to PDF file
            fileStamp.AddStamp(stamp);

            // Save updated PDF file
            fileStamp.Save(_dataDir + "AddTextStamp-All_out.pdf");

            // Close fileStamp
            fileStamp.Close();
        }
```

## Add Text Stamp on Particular Pages in a PDF File

[PdfFileStamp](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdffilestamp) class allows you to add text stamp on particular pages of a PDF file.

You also need to create the text stamp using [BindLogo](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/stamp/methods/bindlogo) method of [Stamp](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/stamp) class. You can set other attributes like origin, rotation, background etc. using [Stamp](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/stamp) object as well. As you want to add text stamp on particular pages of the PDF file, you also need to set the  [Pages](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/stamp/properties/pages) property of the [Stamp](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/stamp) class. This property requires an integer array containing numbers of the pages on which you want to add the stamp. Then you can add the stamp in the PDF file using [AddStamp](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdffilestamp/methods/addstamp) method of [PdfFileStamp](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdffilestamp) class. Finally, save the output PDF file using [Close](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/facade/methods/close) method of [PdfFileStamp](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/pdffilestamp) class.

            // Open Document
            fileStamp.BindPdf(_dataDir + "sample.pdf");

            // Create stamp
            Aspose.Pdf.Facades.Stamp stamp = new Aspose.Pdf.Facades.Stamp();
            stamp.BindLogo(new FormattedText("Hello World!", System.Drawing.Color.Blue, System.Drawing.Color.Gray, Aspose.Pdf.Facades.FontStyle.Helvetica, EncodingType.Winansi, true, 14));
            stamp.SetOrigin(10, 400);
            stamp.Rotation = 90.0F;
            stamp.IsBackground = true;

            // Set particular pages
            stamp.Pages = new int[] { 2 };

            // Add stamp to PDF file
            fileStamp.AddStamp(stamp);

            // Save updated PDF file
            fileStamp.Save(_dataDir + "AddTextStamp-Page_out.pdf");

            // Close fileStamp
