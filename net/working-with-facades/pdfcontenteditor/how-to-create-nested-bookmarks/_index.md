Bookmarks give you the option to keep track/link to specific page inside the PDF document. [PdfContentEditor](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.facades/PdfContentEditor) class in [Aspose.Pdf.Facades namespace](https://docs-qa.aspose.com/display/pdftemp/Aspose.Pdf.Facades+namespace) provides a feature which allows you to create your own bookmark in a sophisticated yet intuitive way within an existing PDF file, at a given page or all pages.

## Implementation details

Other than the creation of simple bookmarks, sometimes you have a requirement to create a bookmark in the form of chapters where you nest the individual bookmarks inside of the chapter bookmarks so that when you click on the + sign for a chapter you would see the pages inside when the bookmarks expands, as shown in the picture below .
 
```csharp
   public static void AddBookmarksAction()
        {
            var document = new Document(_dataDir + "Sample.pdf");
            PdfContentEditor editor = new PdfContentEditor(document);
            editor.CreateBookmarksAction("Bookmark 1", System.Drawing.Color.Green, true, false, string.Empty, "GoTo", "2");

            // Saves the result PDF to file
            editor.Save(_dataDir + "PdfContentEditorDemo_Bookmark.pdf");
        }
```
