- [Links](/pdf/net/links/) - you can easily create, update and extract links with C#.
- [Actions](/pdf/net/actions/) - it is possible to add and get, create  hyperlinks to PDF files. Also, in this article, you will learn how to remove Document Open Action from a PDF File and how to Specify PDF Page when Viewing Document.
- [Bookmarks](/pdf/net/bookmarks/)- large publications usually include a framework of bookmarks that can be easily viewed and selected in the Bookmarks Pane, allowing you to click on a bookmark to jump to the page or chapter it represents. The Bookmarks Pane is a content-aware element, and is visible in the side-bar only if the open PDF document contains a bookmark structure.
