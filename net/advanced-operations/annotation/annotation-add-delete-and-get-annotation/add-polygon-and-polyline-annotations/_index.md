# Add Polygon and Polyline Annotations

The Polyline tool allows you to create shapes and outlines with an arbitrary number of sides on the document. 

**Polygon Annotations** represent polygons on a page. They can have any number of vertices connected by straight lines.

**Polyline annotations** are also similar to polygons, the only difference is that the first and last vertices are not implicitly connected.

The following code snippet shows how to add Polygon and Polyline Annotations to a PDF file.
