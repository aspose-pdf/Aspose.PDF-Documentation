The content inside a PDF page is difficult to edit, but the PDF specification defines a complete set of objects that can be added to PDF pages without changing the page content.

These objects are called annotations, and their purpose ranges from marking up page content to implementing interactive features such as forms.

PDF viewers usually allow the creation and editing of various annotation types, e.g. text highlights, notes, lines, or shapes. Regardless of the annotation types that can be created, PDF viewers conforming to the PDF specification should also support rendering for all annotation types.

Annotation is an important part of PDF file. Using Aspose.PDF for .NET you can add a new annotation, edit an existing annotation and delete annotations and so on. In this section covers the following topic:

You are able to do the following:

- [Overview of Annotations](/pdf/net/overview-of-annotations/) - learn which types of annotations are defined by the PDF specification, and what Aspose.PDF supports.
- [Add, Delete and Get Annotation](/pdf/net/add-delete-and-get-annotation/) - this section explains how to work with all types of allowed annotations.
- [Import and export annotation with XFDF format](/pdf/net/import-export-xfdf/) - Aspose.PDF library provided methods to import and export annotations data to XFDF files.
