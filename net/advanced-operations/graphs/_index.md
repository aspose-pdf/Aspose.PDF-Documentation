## What is Graph

Adding graphs to PDF documents is a very common task for developers while working with Adobe Acrobat Writer or other PDF processing applications. There are many types of graphs that can be used in PDF applications.
[Aspose.PDF for .NET](/pdf/net/) also supports adding graphs to PDF documents. For this purpose, the Graph class is provided. Graph is a paragraph level element and it can be added to the Paragraphs collection in a Page instance. A Graph instance contains a collection of Shapes.

The following types of shapes are supported by the [Graph](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.drawing/graph) class:

- [Arc](/pdf/net/add-arc/) - sometimes also called a flag is an ordered pair of adjacent vertices, but sometimes also called a directed line.
- [Circle](/pdf/net/add-circle/) - displays data using a circle divided into sectors. We use a circle graph (also called a pie chart) to show how data represent portions of one whole or one group.
- [Curve](/pdf/net/add-curve/) - is a connected union of projective lines, each line meeting three others in ordinary double points.
- [Line](/pdf/net/add-line) - line graphs are used to display continuous data and can be useful in predicting future events when they show trends over time.
- [Rectangle](/pdf/net/add-rectangle/) - is one of the many fundamental shapes you'll see in graphs, its can be very useful in helping you solve a problem.
- [Ellipse](/pdf/net/add-ellipse/) - is a set of points on a plane, creating an oval, curved shape.

The above details are also depicted in the figures below:
