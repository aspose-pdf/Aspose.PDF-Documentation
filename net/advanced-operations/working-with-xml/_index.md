XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a way to repurpose data in a file or automate the process of replacing the data in one file with data from another file. Creating an XML schema is hard to get right; creating several interlocking schemas which can be extended is even harder. Let's learn how Aspose.PDF copes with the tasks of working with XML.

- [Supported XML Schema](/pdf/net/supported-xml-schema/) - use the following XML schema for working with XML documents.
- [Simple 'Hello World' example based on XML and XSLT](/pdf/net/create-a-hello-world-pdf-document-through-xml-and-xslt/) - use XSLT to transform your existing XML document to PDF.
- [Generate PDF from XML](/pdf/net/generate-pdf-from-xml/) - Aspose.PDF has several ways to genereate PDF based on XML document.
