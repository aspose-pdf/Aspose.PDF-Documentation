[Aspose.PDF for .NET](/pdf/net/) is a class library which provides the functionality to generate PDF documents from scratch as well as it provides the capability to edit/manipulate existing PDF documents. Aspose.PDF is available in two distinct products [Aspose.PDF for .NET](/pdf/net/) and [Aspose.PDF for Java](/pdf/java/). We can say that Aspose.PDF “natively” supports:

- The .NET Framework and all programming languages targeting the .NET platform, such as C# or VB.NET.
- The Java platform and the Java programming language.

**There are two versions of the Aspose.PDF class library:**

- [Aspose.PDF for .NET](/pdf/net/) to use with any programming language targeting the .NET platform.
- [Aspose.PDF for Java](/pdf/java/) to use with the Java programming language.

Using Aspose.PDF from any other programming language requires the use of some *interoperability technology* . The interoperability technology must allow your programming language to call into a class library written for .NET or Java.
