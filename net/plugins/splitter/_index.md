# How to Split a PDF Document into Multiple Files using Aspose.PDF for .NET

Do you have a large PDF document that you'd like to break down into smaller, more manageable files? With Aspose.PDF for .NET, you can easily achieve this task. In this guide, we'll explore the process of splitting a PDF document into multiple files using the Aspose.PDF.Plugins library. Let's dive into the code and walk through the steps.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the Aspose.PDF for .NET library installed on your system. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so via NuGet using the following command:

```bash
Install-Package Aspose.Pdf
```

Additionally, familiarize yourself with the `SplitOptions` class and its properties. You can find detailed information about this class in the [API Reference](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/SplitOptions/). Note that each output `FileDataSource` represents a single page in the split PDF files.

Now, let's explore the provided code and understand how to split a PDF document.

## Code Walkthrough

The code below demonstrates a PDF splitting demo using the Aspose.PDF.Plugins:

```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf.Plugins;

namespace AsposePluginsNet8.Documentation

// Contains a demo method for splitting a PDF document using Aspose.Pdf.Plugins library.
internal static class SplitterDemo
{
    // Runs the demo to split a PDF document into two separate documents.
    internal static void Run()
    {
        // Set the input path of the PDF document to be split.
        using var inputStream = File.OpenRead(Path.Combine(@"C:\Samples\", "sample-43pages.pdf"));

        // Create a new instance of Splitter.
        var splitter = new Splitter();

        // Create options for splitting the document.
        var options = new SplitOptions();

        // Add input and output data sources to the options.
        options.AddInput(new StreamDataSource(inputStream));

        var document = new Aspose.Pdf.Document(inputStream);

        for (int i = 1; i <= document.Pages.Count; i++)
        {
            var pageNum = string.Format("{0,3}", i.ToString("D3"));
            options.AddOutput(new FileDataSource(Path.Combine(@"C:\Samples\", $"splitter_{pageNum}.pdf")));
        }

        // Process the options to split the document.
        var result = splitter.Process(options);
        Console.WriteLine(result);
    }
}
```

Let's break down the key steps:

1. **Set the Input PDF**

   The code starts by specifying the input PDF document's path to be split. This is done using the `File.OpenRead` method.

2. **Create an Object (Splitter and SplitOptions)**

   The code creates an instance of the `Splitter` class to handle the splitting process. Additionally, an instance of the `SplitOptions` class is created to configure the splitting operation.

3. **Add Data Source (Input and Output)**

   The input PDF document is added to the `SplitOptions` as an input data source using the `AddInput` method. For each page in the document, an output file path is added as an output data source using the `AddOutput` method.

4. **Run Process Method**

   The splitting process is initiated by calling the `Process` method on the `Splitter` class, passing the configured `SplitOptions`. The result of the operation is stored in the `result` variable.

5. **Handle Result**

   The code prints the result to the console, providing information about the splitting process.
