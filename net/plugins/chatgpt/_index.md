## Generating AI-Powered Chat Responses with ChatGpt Plugin

Have you ever wanted to enhance your PDF documents with AI-generated chat responses? Look no further! In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of integrating the powerful [ChatGpt plugin](https://products.aspose.org/pdf/net/chat-gpt/) into your C# application. With just a few simple steps, you'll be generating engaging chat responses effortlessly.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following:

* Visual Studio 2019 or later
* Aspose.PDF for .NET 24.1 or later
* A sample PDF file

## Steps

### 1. Creating an Object

Let's start by creating an object for our chat generation task. The provided C# code snippet demonstrates how to set up options for the PdfChatGpt plugin.

```csharp
// Create options for the ChatGPT plugin.
var options = new PdfChatGptRequestOptions();
```

### 2. Adding a Data Source

Next, we need to add a data source, which in this case, is the input PDF file that contains the text you want to enhance with AI-generated chat responses.

```csharp
// Add input PDF file to the options.
options.AddInput(new FileDataSource("c:\\Samples\\sample.pdf"));

// Add output PDF file to the options.
options.AddOutput(new FileDataSource("c:\\Samples\\chat_results.pdf"));
```

In the code snippet above, we're specifying the input PDF file path and the output path where the enhanced PDF with chat responses will be saved.

### 3. Running the Process Method

Now, let's put everything into action by running the process method. This is where the magic happens â€“ the AI-powered ChatGPT model generates chat responses based on the provided query and text.

```csharp
// Set the API key for authentication.
options.ApiKey = "sk-******";

// Set the maximum number of tokens for the ChatGPT model.
options.MaxTokens = 1000;

// Set the query for the ChatGPT model.
options.Query = "What are the best keywords for this text?";

// Create an instance of the PdfChatGpt plugin.
var plugin = new PdfChatGpt();

// Process the PDF document using the ChatGPT plugin.
var result = await plugin.ProcessAsync(options);
```

With these lines of code, we're configuring authentication, setting parameters for the ChatGPT model, and initiating the chat generation process.
