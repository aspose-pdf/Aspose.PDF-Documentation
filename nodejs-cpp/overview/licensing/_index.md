## Limitation of an evaluation version

We want our customers to test our components thoroughly before buying so the evaluation version allows you to use it as you would normally.

- **PDF created with an evaluation watermark.**
The evaluation version of Aspose.PDF for Node.js via C++ provides full product functionality, but all the pages in the generated PDF documents are watermarked with "Evaluation Only. Created with Aspose.PDF. Copyright 2002-2023 Aspose Pty Ltd." at the top.

- **The limit of the number of collection items that can be processed.**
In the evaluation version from any collection, you can process only four elements (for example, only 4 pages, 4 form fields, etc.).


## Classic license

The license file name must be "aspose.lic". You need to rename the received license file and place it in the Product folder.
