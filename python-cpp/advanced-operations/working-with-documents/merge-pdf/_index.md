## Merge or combine multiple PDF into single PDF in Python via C++

By leveraging Python and a C++ library by Aspose, you can efficiently merge multiple PDF files into a single PDF with ease. 

To concatenate two PDF files:

1. Open first document
1. Then add pages of second document to the first
1. Save concatenated output file with 'document.save' method.

The following code snippet shows how to concatenate PDF files.

```python

    import AsposePDFPythonWrappers as apw
    import AsposePDFPython as apCore
    import os
    import os.path

    dataDir = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "samples")
    input_file= os.path.join(dataDir , "sample0.pdf")
    output_file = os.path.join(dataDir , "results", "concatenated-files.pdf")

    # Open first document
    document1 = apw.Document(inputFile)
    document2 = apw.Document(inputFile)

    # Add pages of second document to the first
    document1.pages.add(document2.pages)

    # Save concatenated output file
    document1.save(output_file)
```
