A tagged PDF document allows people with disabilities to work with it. In addition, accessibility tags in a PDF document give the possibility to make it as easy as possible for screen readers and assistive technologies to work with document with bookmarks, hyperlinks, alt text, etc. 

Aspose.PDF has suffucient functionality to create PDF documents according to PDF/UA standard (it's also known as "Section 508" or "WCAG Standard") and to check the compliance of the created or existing documents with this standard. This Standard describes the requirements for a document that will be used by people with disabilities and devices with limited capabilities to work with these documents. Adding accessibility tags to PDF document means that the created document will have tags, bookmarks, alt text, etc., which will make files accessible to people with visual and mobility disabilities. Using Aspose.PDF it's now possible to create valid accessible PDF documents.
