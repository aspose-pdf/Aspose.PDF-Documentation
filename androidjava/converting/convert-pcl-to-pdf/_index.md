<abbr title="Printer Command Language">PCL</abbr>  (Printer Command Language) is a Hewlett-Packard printer language developed to access standard printer features. PCL levels 1 through 5e/5c are command-based languages that use control sequences which are processed and interpreted in the order they are received. At a consumer level, PCL data streams are generated by a print driver. PCL output can also be easily generated by custom applications.

**Currently, only PCL5 and older versions are supported.**

|**Sets of Commands**|**Support**|**Exceptions**|**Description**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|Job control commands|+|Duplex printing mode|Control print process: number of copies, output bin, simplex/duplex printing, left and top offsets etc.|
|Page control commands|+|Perforation Skip command|Specify a size of page, margins, page orientation inter -lines, -character distances etc.|
|Cursor Positioning Commands|+| |Specify cursor position and, hence, origins of the text, raster or vector images and details.|
|Font selection commands|+|<p>1. Transparent Print Data Command.</p><p>2. Embedded soft fonts. In the current version instead of creating soft font our library selects suitable font from existing "hard" TrueType fonts installed on a target machine. <br>   Suitability is defined by the width/height ratio. <br>   This feature works only for Bitmap and TrueType fonts and does not guarantee that text printed with soft font will be relevant to the one in a source file. <br>   Because character codes in the soft font can unmatched default ones.</p><p>3. User-Defined Symbol Sets.</p>|Allow loading soft (embedded) fonts from the PCL file and managing them in memory.|
|Raster graphics commands|+|Only black & white|Allow loading raster images from PCL file to memory, specify raster parameters <br>such as width, height, compression type, resolution, etc.|
|Color commands|+| |Allow coloring for all printable objects.|
|Print Model commands|+| |Allow filling text, raster images and rectangular areas with raster predefined and user-defined patterns, specify transparency mode for patterns and source raster image. <br>Predefined patterns are hatching, cross-hatch and shading ones.|
|Rectangle area fill commands|+| |Allow creation and filling rectangular areas with patterns.|
|HP-GL/2 Vector Graphics commands|+|Screened Vector Command (SV), Transparency Mode Command (TR), Transparent Data Command (TD), RO (Rotate Coordinate System), Scalable or Bitmap Fonts Command (SB), Character Slant Command (SL) and Extra Space (ES) are not implemented and DV (Define Variable Text Path) commands are realized in beta version.|<p>- Allow loading HP-GL/2 vector images from the PCL file into memory. Vector image has an origin at the lower-left corner of the printable area, can be scaled, translated, rotated and clipped.</p><p>- A vector image can contain text, as labels, and geometric figures such as rectangle, circle, ellipse, line, arc, bezier curve and complex figures composed from the simple ones.</p><p>- Closed figures including letters of labels can be filled with solid fill or vector pattern.</p><p>- The pattern can be hatching, cross-hatch, shading, raster user-defined, PCL hatching or cross-hatch and PCL user-defined. PCL patterns are raster. Labels can be individually rotated, scaled, and directed in four directions: up, down, left and right. Left and Right directions involve one-after-another letter arrangement. Up and Down directions involve one-under-another letter arrangement.</p>|
|Macross|―| |Allow loading a sequence of PCL commands into memory and use this sequence many times, for example, to print page header or set one formatting for a set of pages.|
|Unicode text|―| |Allow printing non-ASCII characters. Not implemented due to lack of sample files with <br>Unicode text|
|PCL6 (PCL-XL)| |Realized only in the Beta version because of lack in test files. Embedded fonts also are not supported. The JetReady extension is not supported because it is impossible to have JetReady specification.|Binary file format.|

## Converting a PCL file into PDF format

To allow conversion from PCL to PDF, [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java) has the class [PclLoadOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/pdf/com.aspose.pdf/PclLoadOptions) which is used to initialize the [LoadOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/pdf/com.aspose.pdf/LoadOptions) object. This object is then passed as an argument during [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/pdf/com.aspose.pdf/document) object initialization and helps the PDF rendering engine to determine the source document's input format.

The following code snippet shows the process of converting a PCL file into PDF format.

```java
package com.aspose.pdf.examples;

import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

import com.aspose.pdf.*;

public final class ConvertPCLtoPDF {

    private ConvertPCLtoPDF() {
        
    }

    private static Path _dataDir = Paths.get("/home/admin1/pdf-examples/Samples");

    public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {        
        ConvertPCLtoPDF_Simple();
        ConvertPCLtoPDF_Advanced();
    }

    public static void ConvertPCLtoPDF_Simple() {
        PclLoadOptions options = new PclLoadOptions();
        Document pdfDocument= new Document(_dataDir + "demo.pcl", options);
        pdfDocument.save(_dataDir + "epub_test.pdf");        
    }

    public static void ConvertPCLtoPDF_Advanced() {
        PclLoadOptions options = new PclLoadOptions();
        options.SupressErrors=true;
        Document pdfDocument= new Document(_dataDir + "demo.pcl", options);
        if (options.Exceptions!=null)
            for (Exception ex : options.Exceptions)
            {
                System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
            }
        pdfDocument.save(_dataDir + "pcl_test.pdf");        
    }
}
```

## Known Issues

1. Origin of text strings and images can slightly differ from the ones in a source PCL file if the print direction is not 0º. The same refers to vector images if coordinate system of vector plot is rotated (RO command preceded).
1. Origin of labels in vector images can be differ from the ones in a source PCL file if the labels are influenced by a sequence of commands: Label Origin (LO), Define Variable Text Path (DV), Absolute Direction (DI) or Relative Direction (DR).
1. A text can be incorrectly read if it must be rendered with Bitmap or TrueType soft (embedded) font, because currently these fonts are only partially supported (see exceptions in "Supported features table"). In this situation text can be correctly read only if character codes in a soft font corresponds to default ones. A style of the read text also can be differed from the one in source PCL file because it is not necessary to set style in soft font header.
1. If parsed PCL file contains Intellifont or Universal soft fonts, an exception will be thrown, because Intellifont and Universal font are not supported at all.
1. If parsed PCL file contains macros commands the result of parsing will strongly differ from the source file, because macros commands are not supported.
