Splitting PDF pages can be a useful feature for those who want to split a large file into separate pages or groups of pages.

## Live Example

[Aspose.PDF Splitter](https://products.aspose.app/pdf/splitter) is an online free web application that allows you to investigate how presentation splitting functionality works.

This topic shows how to split PDF pages into individual PDF files in your Python applications. To split PDF pages into single page PDF files using Python, the following steps can be followed:

1. Loop through the pages of PDF document through the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/document/) object's [PageCollection](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/pagecollection/) collection
1. For each iteration, create a new Document object and add the individual [Page](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/page/) object into the empty document
1. Save the new PDF using [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/document/#methods) method

## Split PDF into multiple files or separate pdfs in Python
The following Python code snippet shows you how to split PDF pages into individual PDF files.

```python

    import aspose.pdf as ap

    # Open document
    document = ap.Document(input_pdf)

    page_count = 1

    # Loop through all the pages
    for pdfPage in document.pages:
        new_document = ap.Document()
        new_document.pages.add(pdfPage)
        new_document.save(output_path + "_page_" + str(page_count) + ".pdf")
        page_count = page_count + 1
```
