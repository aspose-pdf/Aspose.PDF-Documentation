Attachments can contain a wide variety of information and can be of a variety of file types. This article explains how to add an attachment to a PDF file.

1. Create a new Python project.
1. Import the Aspose.PDF package
1. Create a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/document/) object.
1. Create a [FileSpecification](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/filespecification/) object with the file you are adding, and file description.
1. Add the [FileSpecification](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/filespecification/) object to the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/document/) object’s [EmbeddedFileCollection](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/embeddedfilecollection/) collection, with the collection’s [add](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/embeddedfilecollection/#methods) method.

The [EmbeddedFileCollection](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/embeddedfilecollection/) collection contains all the attachments in the PDF file. The following code snippet shows you how to add an attachment in a PDF document.

```python

    import aspose.pdf as ap

    # Open document
    document = ap.Document(input_pdf)

    # Setup new file to be added as attachment
    fileSpecification = ap.FileSpecification(attachment_file, "Sample text file")

    # Add attachment to document's attachment collection
    document.embedded_files.append(fileSpecification)

    # Save new output
    document.save(output_pdf)
```
