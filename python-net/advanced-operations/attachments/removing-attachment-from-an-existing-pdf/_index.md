Aspose.PDF for Python can remove attachments from PDF files. A PDF document's attachments are held in the Document object's [EmbeddedFiles](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/embeddedfilecollection/) collection.

To delete all attachments associated with a PDF file:

1. Call the [EmbeddedFiles](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/embeddedfilecollection/) collection's [delete()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/embeddedfilecollection/#methods) method.
1. Save the updated file using the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/document/) object's [save()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-net/aspose.pdf/document/#methods) method.

The following code snippet shows how to remove attachments from a PDF document.

```python

    import aspose.pdf as ap

    # Open document
    document = ap.Document(input_pdf)

    # Delete all attachments
    document.embedded_files.delete()

    # Save updated file
    document.save(output_pdf)
```
