## Fundamentals of AcroForms

**AcroForms** are the original PDF forms technology. AcroForms is a page oriented form. They were first introduced in 1998. They accept input in Forms Data Format or FDF and XML Forms Data Format or xFDF. Third party vendors support AcroForms. When Adobe introduced the AcroForms, they referred to them as “PDF form that is authored with Adobe Acrobat Pro/Standard and that is not a special type of static or dynamic XFA form. Acroforms are portable and they work on all platforms.

You can use AcroForms to add additional pages to the PDF form document. Thanks to the concept of Templates, you can use AcroForms to support populating the form with multiple database records.

PDF 1.7 supports two different methods for integrating data and PDF forms.

*AcroForms (also known as Acrobat forms)*, introduced and included in the PDF 1.2 format specification.

For more detailed learning of the capabilities of the Java library, see the following articles:

- [Create AcroForm](/pdf/python-net/create-form) - create form from scratch with Python.
- [Fill AcroForm](/pdf/python-net/fill-form) - fill form field in your PDF document.
- [Extract AcroForm](/pdf/python-net/extract-form) - get value from all or an individual field of PDF document.
