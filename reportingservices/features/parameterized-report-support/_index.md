A parameterized report is a report that accepts input values used in report processing. With a parameterized report, you can vary the output of a report based on values that are set when the report runs.

Aspose.PDF for Reporting Services supports two kinds of parameters:

- Report server parameters: used for all the reports on the report server.
- Report parameters: parameters suitable for specific reports rather than all.
