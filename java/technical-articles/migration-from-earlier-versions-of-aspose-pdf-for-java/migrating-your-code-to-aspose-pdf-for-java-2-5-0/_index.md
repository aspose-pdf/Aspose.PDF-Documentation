In this article we have tried highlighting some of the areas from an existing code of Aspose.PDF for Java to make it compatible with the latest release version.

{{% /alert %}}

## Details

With the release of Aspose.PDF for Java 2.5.0, there have been lots of changes in the API structure and class es construction. M ost of the class member's names are updated, some existing class members are removed and also few more methods and properties are added to existing classes. Just to give you a brief of changes, we a re going to have a look over the following simple code , based over Aspose.PDF for Java versions published earlier to 2.5.0.

In this simple code, we will add a hyperlink and link to the page within the same PDF document.

```java
import com.aspose.pdf.elements.*;
com.aspose.pdf.License lic = new com.aspose.pdf.License();

try {

lic.setLicense(new FileInputStream(new File("Aspose.Total.Java.lic")));

    } catch (Exception e)

{

System.out.println(e.getMessage());

}


//Instantiate a Pdf object by calling its empty constructor

Pdf pdf1 = new Pdf();

//Create a section in the Pdf object

Section sec1 = pdf1.getSections().add();

//Create text paragraph with the reference of a section

Text text1 = new Text(sec1);

//Add the text paragraph in the paragraphs collection of the section

sec1.getParagraphs().add(text1);

//Add a text segment in the text paragraph

Segment segment1 = text1.getSegments().add("this is a local link");

//Set the text in the text segment to be underlined

segment1.getTextInfo().setUnderLine(true);


//Set the link type of the text segment to Local

//Assign the id of the desired paragraph as a target id for the text segment

segment1.setHyperLink(new HyperLinkToLocalPdf("product1"));

//Create a text paragraph to be linked with the text segment

Text text3 = new Text(sec1,"product 1 info ...");

//Add the text paragraph to paragraphs collection of the section

sec1.getParagraphs().add(text3);

//Set this paragraph to be the first so that it can be displayed in a separate

//page in the document

text3.setFirstParagraph(true);

//Set the id of this text segment to "product1"

text3.setID("product1"); 


// save the PDF file

FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(new File("UpdateOfCode_Test.pdf"));

pdf1.save(out);
```

When using the versions earlier to Aspose.PDF for Java 2.5.0, the code can successfully be executed and a resultant PDF document containing a hyperlink towards a page within the same document , can be generated. But, when the same code is compiled with 2.5.0 , you will notice number of errors because , there ha ve been change s in the class members and also some of the methods in classes have been removed . Now let ’ s start with the modification of code for version 2.5.0

Use `import aspose.pdf.*` ; instead of `import com.aspose.pdf.elements.*`; to include the package.

For license initialization, please update your existing code from 


{{% alert color="primary" %}}
**com.aspose.pdf.License lic = new com.aspose.pdf.License();**

```java

 try
{
lic.setLicense(new FileInputStream(new File("Aspose.Total.Java.lic")));
}

```

{{% /alert %}}

to 


{{% alert color="primary" %}}
**aspose.pdf.License lic = new aspose.pdf.License();**

```java

 try
{
lic.setLicense(new FileInputStream(new File("Aspose.Total.Java.lic")));
}

```

{{% /alert %}}

**TextInfo** does not contain a method **setUnderLine(...)** anymore. Please try using **TextInfo.setIsUnderline(...)** ** instead **.**

The class named  **HyperLinkToLocalPdf** has been removed. So please update your any existing code like


{{% alert color="primary" %}}
**//Set the link type of the text segment to Local**

```java

 //Assign the id of the desired paragraph as a target id for the text segment

segment1.setHyperLink(new HyperLinkToLocalPdf("product1"));

```

{{% /alert %}}

to

{{% alert color="primary" %}}
**segment1.getHyperlink().setLinkType(HyperlinkType.Local);**

```java

 segment1.getHyperlink().setTargetID("product1");

```

{{% /alert %}}

The method name **setFirstParagraph** is removed from Text class . So in order to display the text segment in new page, you need to create a new Section object and add the text object to the newly created section. As b y default every section is displayed over new page, so there is no need for calling a method like **sec2.setIsNewPage(true**)**;

## Updated Save method

The save method in Pdf class which used to take FileOutputStream object as an argument, has been removed. In new version, you can use either of the following overloaded method s of save.

- save(BasicStream stream)
- save(java.lang.String pdfFile)
- save(java.lang.String fileName, SaveType saveType, aspose.pdf.HttpResponse response)

After making all above specified changes, when using Aspose.PDF for Java 2.5.0 , the code will be compiled and executed without showing any error message s. The complete update d code snippet is specified below.

```java
import aspose.pdf.*;
aspose.pdf.License lic = new aspose.pdf.License();

try {

lic.setLicense(new FileInputStream(new File("Aspose.Total.Java.lic")));

    } catch (Exception e)

{

System.out.println(e.getMessage());

}

try {

//Instantiate a Pdf object by calling its empty constructor

Pdf pdf1 = new Pdf();

//Create a section in the Pdf object

Section sec1 = pdf1.getSections().add();

//Create text paragraph with the reference of a section

Text text1 = new Text(sec1);

//Add the text paragraph in the paragraphs collection of the section

sec1.getParagraphs().add(text1);

//Add a text segment in the text paragraph

Segment segment1 = text1.getSegments().add("this is a local link");

//Set the text in the text segment to be underlined

segment1.getTextInfo().setIsUnderline(true);


//Set the link type of the text segment to Local

//Assign the id of the desired paragraph as a target id for the text segment

segment1.getHyperlink().setLinkType(HyperlinkType.Local);

segment1.getHyperlink().setTargetID("product1");

// add a new section which will hold the text object with ID "Product 1"

Section sec2 = pdf1.getSections().add();

//Create a text paragraph to be linked with the text segment

Text text3 = new Text(sec1,"product 1 info ...");

//Add the text paragraph to paragraphs collection of the section

sec2.getParagraphs().add(text3);

//Set the id of this text segment to "product1"

text3.setID("product1");


// save the PDF file

pdf1.save("UpdateOfCode_Test.pdf");


     }catch(Exception e)

{

System.out.println(e.getMessage());

}
```
