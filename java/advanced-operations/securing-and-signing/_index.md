This article describes how digital signatures are represented in a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for Java.
Digital signatures can be used for many types of documents where traditional pen-and-ink signatures
were used in the past. However, the mere existence of a digital signature is not adequate assurance that
a document is what it appears to be. Moreover, government and enterprise settings often need to
impose additional constraints on their signature workflows, such as restricting user choices and
document behavior during and after signing.
