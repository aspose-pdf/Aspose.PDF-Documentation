## What is ZUGFeRD

Electronic invoicing, or e-invoicing, is a digital way of creating, sending, receiving, and processing an invoice document. It eliminates paper and improves efficiency and savings for businesses in a B2B context. E-invoicing benefits both buyers and sellers.

As more and more companies adopt e-invoicing to gain its advantages, they need standards to make sure that e-invoices can be easily understood by any software, no matter how they are created.

Among the various data formats for e-invoices, the ZUGFeRD standard is becoming more popular in German-speaking and EU countries.

ZUGFeRD is a German standard for electronic invoicing. It stands for "Central User Guide of the Forum for Electronic Invoicing Germany".

The format is a hybrid that mixes a PDF document that can be read by humans and a XML data file that can be read by machines. It enables the exchange of invoice information between businesses and public authorities in a consistent and compatible way.

It also meets the legal requirements for long-term archiving and tax compliance. ZUGFeRD has different versions and profiles that match different needs and scenarios. The latest version is ZUGFeRD 2.0, which is in line with the European standard EN 16931 for electronic invoicing.
ZUGFeRD provides many benefits and cost savings for users, such as quicker processing, fewer errors, better cash flow, and less environmental impact.
