**<abbr title="Electronic Publication">EPUB</abbr>** is a free and open e-book standard from the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). Files have the extension .epub.
EPUB is designed for reflowable content, meaning that an EPUB reader can optimize text for a particular display device. EPUB also supports fixed-layout content. The format is intended as a single format that publishers and conversion houses can use in-house, as well as for distribution and sale. It supersedes the Open eBook standard.

Aspose.PDF for Python also supports the feature to convert PDF documents to EPUB format. Aspose.PDF for Python has a class named 'EpubSaveOptions' which can be used as the second argument to [Document.Save()](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-java/aspose.pdf/document/#methods) method, to generate an EPUB file.
Please try using the following code snippet to accomplish this requirement with Python.

```python

from asposepdf import Api

# init license
documentName = "testdata/license/Aspose.PDF.PythonviaJava.lic"
licenseObject = Api.License()
licenseObject.setLicense(documentName)

# Convert to Epub
documentName = "testdata/Hello.pdf"
doc = Api.Document(documentName, None)
documentOutName = "testout/out.epub"
doc.save(documentOutName, Api.SaveFormat.Epub)
```

## Convert PDF to LaTeX/TeX

To convert PDF files to TeX, Aspose.PDF has the class [LaTeXSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/python-java/aspose.pdf/latexsaveoptions/) which provides the property OutDirectoryPath for saving temporary images during the conversion process.

The following code snippet shows the process of converting PDF files into the TEX format with Python.

```python
from asposepdf import Api

documentName = "testdata/Hello.pdf"
doc = Api.Document(documentName, None)
documentOutName = "testout/out.tex"
doc.save(documentOutName, Api.SaveFormat.TeX)
```

## Convert PDF to Text

**Aspose.PDF for Python** support converting whole PDF document and single page to a Text file.

The following code snippet explains how to extract the texts from the all pages.

```python

from asposepdf import Api, Device

DIR_INPUT = "testdata/"
DIR_OUTPUT = "testout/"

input_pdf = DIR_INPUT + "source.pdf"
output_pdf = DIR_OUTPUT + "convert_pdf_to_text"
# Open PDF document
document = Api.Document(input_pdf)

device = Device.TextDevice()

for i in range(0, document.getPages.size):
    imageFileName = output_pdf + "_page_" + str(i + 1) + "_out.txt"
    # Convert a particular page and save as text file
    device.process(document.getPages.getPage(i + 1), imageFileName)
```
