You'll learn different ways to:

- [Working with Documents](/pdf/python-java/working-with-documents/) - compress, split, and merge documents and make other operations with the whole document.
- [Working with Pages](/pdf/python-java/working-with-pages/) - add, move or remove, crop pages, add watermarks, stamps, and etc.
- [Working with Forms](/pdf/python-java/working-with-forms/) - deal with interact PDF documents, add formfields, extract data.
- [Working with Text](/pdf/python-java/working-with-text/) - add, format, search and replace text in PDF.
